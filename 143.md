# Truncation Error in CentralizedOracle's Price Validation Allows Setting Prices Below Intended Threshold

### Summary
The `updateTokenPrice` function in the `CentralizedOracle` contract contains a validation check that is vulnerable to truncation errors due to integer division. This allows the owner to set a price slightly below the intended minimum threshold of `_currentPrice / 5` without triggering the validation error.

### Vulnerability Details
In the `updateTokenPrice` function, there's a check to prevent setting prices that deviate too much from the current price:
```solidity
if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5)
    revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
```
Due to Solidity's integer division, the result of `_currentPrice / 5` is truncated. This creates a vulnerability where a new price that is slightly below the actual 20% threshold might still pass the validation.

**Example:**
- the `_currentPrice` is 1001, `1001 / 5 = 200.2`, but will be truncated to `200`
- The `usdPerToken` is 200, the check will pass even if in reality `200 < 200.2`

**Note:**
In the `README.md` it's mentioned that:
> The oracle rounds prices down in both directions `usd->pin` and `pin->usd`. This is accepted for this MVP, unless there is a way to exploit this and steal user funds.

This refers to the rounding behavior in the conversion functions, not the validation check in the `updateTokenPrice` function that contains the truncation vulnerability.

### Impact
The owner can set prices that are slightly below the intended minimum threshold

### Recommendation
```diff
- if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5)
-            revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
+  if (usdPerToken * 5 < _currentPrice)
+           revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
```
