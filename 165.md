# Users’ staking rewards may be lost

### Summary

When the OPERATOR_ROLE opens a new stake by using the depositRewards function, the user's previous stake rewards may be lost.

### Root Cause

```solidity
// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L87

    function depositRewards(RewardsStream storage self, uint256 amount, uint256 drippingPeriod) internal {
        if (drippingPeriod > MAX_DRIPPING_PERIOD) revert PinlinkRewards_DrippingPeriodTooLong();
        if (drippingPeriod < MIN_DRIPPING_PERIOD) revert PinlinkRewards_DrippingPeriodTooShort();

        if (!self.isDrippingPeriodFinished()) revert PinlinkRewards_DepositRewardsTooEarly();
        if (!self.isEnabled()) revert PinlinkRewards_AssetNotEnabled();

        // This ensures rounding errors are negligible (less than 0.01$ per deposit)
        if (amount < MIN_REWARDS_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT) revert PinlinkRewards_AmountTooLow();

        // The number of fractions per asset is expected to be on the order of 100.
        // Thus, precision loss will usually be negligible (on the order of less than 100 wei)
        // Therefore, precision loss is deliberately ignored here to save gas
        uint256 delta = (amount * PRECISION) / self.assetSupply;
        /// The dripping mechanism is to avoid step jumps in rewards
        self.globalRewardsPerStakedTarget += delta;
        self.deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked = delta;
        self.lastDepositTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        self.drippingPeriod = drippingPeriod;
    }

    function globalRewardsPerStaked(RewardsStream storage self) internal view returns (uint256) {
        if (self.lastDepositTimestamp == 0) return 0;

        // safe subtraction as is always less or equal to block.timestamp
        uint256 timeSinceDeposit = block.timestamp - self.lastDepositTimestamp;

        uint256 _drippingDuration = self.drippingPeriod;
        // if the _drippingDuration has passed, then locked is 0
        // at deposit, locked has to be deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked
        // during the _drippingDuration, locked is an interpolation between deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked and 0
        uint256 locked = (timeSinceDeposit > _drippingDuration)
            ? 0
            : self.deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked * (_drippingDuration - (timeSinceDeposit)) / _drippingDuration;

        /// return the target after _drippingDuration, and before that, an interpolation between last and new target
        return self.globalRewardsPerStakedTarget - locked;
    }

```

When a new stake is opened in OPERATOR_ROLE, if the user did not call claimRewards() function or participate in transferBalances() function in the last stake (the user purchased tokens for the first time, although transferBalances() function was called, the user did not stake tokens at this time), then the rewards of the user's last stake will be lost. Because of the update of lastDepositTimestamp and drippingPeriod, the records of the last stake rewards are all reset.

unnecessary

### Impact

The user’s last staking reward may be lost.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that all stakers claim their staking rewards before updating.
