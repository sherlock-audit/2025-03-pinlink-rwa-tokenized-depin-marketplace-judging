# Denial-of-Service via Listing Spam

### Summary

An attacker can spam PinlinkShop.list with minimal fractions and short deadlines, bloating _listings and _listedBalances mappings. This increases gas costs for sellers delisting expired listings and disrupts normal user actions like withdrawals, especially on L2 with low fees.

### Root Cause

- In PinlinkShop._list:

```solidity

require(amount > 0, ExpectedNonZeroAmount());
require(deadline > block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());
_listings[listingId] = Listing({...});
_listedBalances[fractionalAssets][tokenId][msg.sender] += amount;
```
- No minimum amount or deadline duration allows spam with 1-fraction listings that expire instantly.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Attacker owns fractions of an enabled asset.
- Low transaction fees (e.g., on L2) make spamming feasible.

### External Pre-conditions

- Attacker repeatedly calls list with minimal parameters.

### Attack Path

- Attacker owns 1000 fractions of tokenId=1.
- Attacker calls list 1000 times, each with 1 fraction and deadline = block.timestamp + 1.
- Listings expire next block, remaining in _listings until delisted.
- Seller must call delist 1000 times, incurring high gas costs.
- Buyers waste gas on expired listings, disrupting purchases.

### Impact

- Sellers face increased gas costs to delist, hindering withdrawals.
- Buyers experience DoS-like effects, reducing marketplace usability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Enforce a minimum amount (e.g., 10 fractions) and deadline (e.g., 1 hour) in list.
- Auto-prune expired listings in purchase or delist to reduce storage bloat.
