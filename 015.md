# Multiple Listings of Same Token Enables Double-Spending and Overselling

## Description

In `PinlinkShop::_list`, there is no validation to prevent a seller from creating multiple listings for the same token with either identical or different parameters. This allows:

1. Double-spending of the same token fractions across multiple listings
2. Overselling by listing more fractions than actually owned

The issue occurs because:

- The `listingId` is generated using parameters that can be varied (price, deadline, block.number)
- There is no tracking of total listed amount vs owned amount across all listings
- Only individual listing amounts are tracked

## Proof of Concept

#### according to the protocol team, the user can only list twice with different prices, deadline or amount.. but the user can make another listing with the same values, run the `test_listingByAlice_twiceInNextBlock` function with the following changes:

```solidity
function test_listingByAlice_twiceInNextBlock() public {
        uint256 amount = 3;
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        pshop.list(address(fractions), asset1, amount, 1000e18, block.timestamp + 7 days);

        vm.roll(block.number + 1);

        pshop.list(address(fractions), asset1, amount, 1000e18, block.timestamp + 7 days);

        assertEq(_listedBalance(address(fractions), asset1, alice), amount * 2);
    }
```

#### Overselling by listing more fractions than actually owned

1. User owns 100 fractions of tokenId 1
2. User creates Listing A for 100 fractions at price 1 ETH
3. User creates Listing B for same 100 fractions at price 2 ETH
4. Both listings are valid since `_nonListedBalance` only checks against individual listing amounts
5. Two buyers could purchase all 100 fractions from each listing (200 total) despite user only owning 100

## Impact

Critical. This allows:

- Double-spending of token fractions
- Overselling beyond owned balance
- Potential loss of funds for buyers when purchases cannot be fulfilled

## Recommendations

1. Track total listed amount across all listings:
2. Require unique parameter combinations:
3. Implement a single listing per token per seller:
