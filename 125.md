# Inconsistent Asset Supply Boundary Check in `enableAsset` Function


## Summary
The `enableAsset` function's validation logic for asset supply uses a strictly less than (`<`) comparison against `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY` rather than less than or equal to (`<=`). This inconsistency permits asset supply values exactly equal to `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY`, potentially violating intended system constraints.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L66

## Vulnerability Details
The current implementation uses an incorrect comparison operator in the supply limit validation:

```solidity
require(assetSupply < MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh());
```

This check allows `assetSupply` to be exactly equal to `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY`, which may contradict the intended maximum boundary for asset supplies in the system.

## Impact
- Potential violation of system-wide asset supply constraints
- Inconsistencies if other components assume `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY` is a strict upper limit
- Possible unexpected behavior in reward calculations or distribution mechanisms

## Mitigation
Update the validation check to use the correct comparison operator that aligns with the intended supply limit boundary:

```solidity
require(assetSupply <= MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh());
```

This ensures that `assetSupply` cannot exceed `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY`, maintaining the intended constraint across the system.
