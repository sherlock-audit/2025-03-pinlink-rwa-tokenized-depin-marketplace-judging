# Wallet Balance Limitation Causing Transaction Failures in Fractionalized Asset Purchases

### Summary

A wallet balance restriction in the PIN token contract prevents buyers from successfully purchasing large quantities of fractionalized assets. The issue arises when a buyer's wallet balance, after a transaction, exceeds the set limit of 10,000 PIN tokens. As a result, the transaction reverts, preventing the purchase from being completed. The restriction is enforced by the contract’s logic, which ensures that a wallet cannot hold more than `totalTokens / maxWalletRatio.`
Relevant Contract Code (PIN Token Contract)
```solidity

require(balanceOf(to) + amount <= totalTokens / maxWalletRatio, "Max wallet will be exceeded.");

```

Example Scenarios That Trigger This Issue
Large Purchase Transactions

A buyer intends to purchase 10,000 fractionalized assets, with each asset priced at 1.5 PIN tokens.
This results in a transfer of 15,000 PIN tokens to the supplier’s wallet.
If the supplier’s wallet already holds some PIN tokens, this transfer could push their balance beyond the 10,000 PIN token limit, causing the transaction to fail.
High-Priced Fractionalized Assets

The supplier sets a high price for each fractionalized asset (e.g., 100 PIN tokens per unit).
Even a small number of assets (e.g., 150 assets at 100 PIN each) would surpass the 10,000 PIN token limit.
This leads to transaction failures even if the total transaction amount is otherwise valid.
Despite the transaction being legitimate, the enforced balance restriction results in transaction reverts, making high-value or large-scale purchases infeasible.



### Root Cause

The core problem is an arbitrary wallet balance cap implemented in the PIN token contract. The contract checks if a recipient’s post-transaction balance exceeds the allowed limit `(totalTokens / maxWalletRatio)` before executing the transfer. If the balance surpasses this threshold, the transaction is reverted with the error message:

"Max wallet will be exceeded."

Relevant Code in _transfer() Function
```solidity

// Checks if the recipient's balance will exceed the max wallet limit
require(
    balanceOf(to) + amount <= totalTokens / maxWalletRatio,  
    "Max wallet will be exceeded."
);

```

This condition applies to all token transfers, restricting suppliers from receiving large sums of PIN tokens from buyers, even if both parties are willing and able to proceed with the trade.

### Attack Path

### Impact

1. Transaction Failures
Buyers attempting to purchase fractionalized assets in bulk will experience failed transactions.
Any attempt to exceed the 10,000 PIN token balance limit results in reverts, preventing transactions from being processed.
2. Purchase Restrictions
Even if buyers have sufficient funds, they cannot purchase large asset quantities if the resulting transfer would exceed the supplier’s token balance limit.
This restricts scalability and hampers the efficiency of large transactions.
3. Increased Complexity for Users
Buyers and suppliers must manually monitor their wallet balances to ensure transactions stay within the 10,000 PIN token limit.
This creates operational inefficiencies, delays, and potential confusion for users.
4. Reduced Transaction Flexibility
The imposed limitation reduces flexibility for both buyers and suppliers.
High-value or bulk transactions are artificially constrained, making it difficult to conduct large-scale trades.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Modify the PIN Token Contract (Preferred Solution)
If possible, update the PIN token contract to remove or adjust the wallet balance restriction. Instead of enforcing a strict cap, consider alternative mechanisms such as:

Implementing whitelisted exemptions for marketplace transactions.
Allowing balance limits to be dynamically adjusted based on transaction needs.
2. Redesign the Marketplace Transaction Process
If modifying the PIN token contract is not feasible, consider reworking the transaction execution logic:

Split large purchases into multiple transactions to avoid exceeding the 10,000 PIN token limit.
Use an escrow mechanism where tokens are not directly transferred to the supplier but are instead settled in batches.
Introduce a custom transfer function that allows bypassing the limit for marketplace transactions without impacting other wallet holders.
