# Seller can selectively deny specific buyers and choose to sell to someone particular

## Description
A seller could:
1. List an asset at a certain price or `usdPricePerFraction`.
2. When they see a buyer's purchase transaction in the mempool front-run with [modifyListing()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L269) to increase the price so the buyer's `maxTotalPinAmount` parameter inside [purchase](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L288) is exceeded.
3. The buyer's transaction fails with `SlippageExceeded`.
4. The seller back-runs with another `modifyListing()` to restore the original price.

This allows sellers to selectively deny specific buyers while maintaining the listing for others they prefer to sell to. This allows them to choose the specific buyer to sell to.

## Impact
1. **Selective selling**: The seller could discriminate against specific addresses, perhaps to sell only to approved buyers from off-chain agreements.
2. **MEV extraction**: If the PIN token price is volatile, a seller could monitor price movements and block purchases when the price is disadvantageous to them.
3. **Regulatory circumvention**: In some jurisdictions, refusing to sell based on certain characteristics is illegal. This provides a technical method to do so with plausible deniability.

## Proof of Concept
Add this as a new file inside `test/pinlinkShop/` and run to see it pass:

        vm.revertTo(snapshotId);
        
        // Now demonstrate the sandwich attack
        // 1. Alice front-runs Bob's transaction and increases the price
        vm.prank(alice);
        pshop.modifyListing(listingId, sandwichedPrice, 0);

        vm.prank(alice);

```

## Mitigation 
A potential mitigation would be implementing a time delay between price modifications before allowing them to take effect, at least a block or two.
