# Timestamp Manipulation

### Summary

The StreamHandler library relies on block.timestamp in its reward dripping mechanism to calculate the progression of rewards over time. Specifically, functions like globalRewardsPerStaked and isDrippingPeriodFinished use block.timestamp to determine how much of the deposited rewards have been "dripped" to stakers and whether a new reward deposit is allowed. In Ethereum, miners (or validators in a post-merge context) can manipulate block.timestamp within a small window (typically ±15 seconds, though this depends on network conditions and client implementations). This manipulation introduces a vulnerability where a malicious miner could skew reward distribution, either accelerating or delaying the dripping process to favor certain accounts (e.g., themselves or colluding parties), thereby undermining the fairness of the rewards system. 



### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from the use of block.timestamp in two key functions:
1. globalRewardsPerStaked
```solidity

function globalRewardsPerStaked(RewardsStream storage self) internal view returns (uint256) {
    if (self.lastDepositTimestamp == 0) return 0;
    uint256 timeSinceDeposit = block.timestamp - self.lastDepositTimestamp;
    uint256 _drippingDuration = self.drippingPeriod;
    uint256 locked = (timeSinceDeposit > _drippingDuration)
        ? 0
        : self.deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked * (_drippingDuration - timeSinceDeposit) / _drippingDuration;
    return self.globalRewardsPerStakedTarget - locked;
}
```
Purpose: Calculates the current rewards per staked token, interpolating between the last reward state and the target based on time elapsed since the last deposit.

Timestamp Usage: timeSinceDeposit = block.timestamp - self.lastDepositTimestamp determines how much of the deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked has been released.

2. isDrippingPeriodFinished
```solidity

function isDrippingPeriodFinished(RewardsStream storage self) internal view returns (bool) {
    return block.timestamp > self.lastDepositTimestamp + self.drippingPeriod;
}
```
Purpose: Checks if the current dripping period has ended, allowing a new reward deposit.

Timestamp Usage: Compares block.timestamp to self.lastDepositTimestamp + self.drippingPeriod.

Supporting Functions
depositRewards: Sets self.lastDepositTimestamp = block.timestamp, establishing the baseline for future calculations.
solidity

self.lastDepositTimestamp = block.timestamp;

### Attack Path

Scenario 1: Accelerating Reward Dripping
Initial State:
lastDepositTimestamp = 1000 (set by depositRewards).

drippingPeriod = 6 hours = 21,600 seconds.

deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked = 1e18 (1 reward unit per staked token).

globalRewardsPerStakedTarget = 2e18.

Normal Execution:
At block.timestamp = 1015 (15 seconds later), timeSinceDeposit = 15.

locked = 1e18 * (21,600 - 15) / 21,600 ≈ 1e18 * 21,585 / 21,600 ≈ 0.99930556e18.

globalRewardsPerStaked = 2e18 - 0.99930556e18 ≈ 1.00069444e18.

Manipulated Execution:
Miner sets block.timestamp = 1030 (30 seconds later, +15 seconds manipulation).

timeSinceDeposit = 30.

locked = 1e18 * (21,600 - 30) / 21,600 ≈ 0.99861111e18.

globalRewardsPerStaked = 2e18 - 0.99861111e18 ≈ 1.00138889e18.

Impact:
Reward per staked token increases from 1.00069444e18 to 1.00138889e18, a difference of 0.00069445e18 per token.

For a staker with 1,000 tokens, this is 694.45 wei more rewards claimed (assuming USDC with 6 decimals, negligible; but scales with larger stakes or token decimals).

Scenario 2: Delaying Reward Dripping

Manipulated Execution:
Miner sets block.timestamp = 1000 (same as deposit, delaying progress).

timeSinceDeposit = 0.

locked = 1e18 * 21,600 / 21,600 = 1e18.

globalRewardsPerStaked = 2e18 - 1e18 = 1e18.

Impact:
Stakers claim no additional rewards (1e18 instead of 1.00069444e18), losing 0.00069444e18 per token until the next block.

Scenario 3: Blocking Deposits
Initial State:
lastDepositTimestamp = 1000, drippingPeriod = 6 hours = 21,600 seconds.

Next block at block.timestamp = 22,600 (normal end of period).

Normal Execution:
isDrippingPeriodFinished = 22,600 > (1000 + 21,600) = true, allowing a new deposit.

Manipulated Execution:
Miner sets block.timestamp = 22,585 (-15 seconds).

isDrippingPeriodFinished = 22,585 > 21,600 = false.

Impact:
Operator’s depositRewards transaction reverts with PinlinkRewards_DepositRewardsTooEarly(), delaying reward distribution by at least one block.



### Impact

Reward Manipulation:
Maximum shift: ±15 seconds over MIN_DRIPPING_PERIOD = 21,600 seconds is ~0.0694% of the dripping period.

For deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked = 1e18, this shifts rewards by ~`0.000694e18` per token per claim.

For 1,000 staked tokens and 1,000 claims daily, a miner could gain/lose ~`694,000 wei` (0.000694 USDC with 6 decimals) daily—small but cumulative.

Deposit Timing:
Delaying deposits by 15 seconds could force operators to wait, potentially missing reward cycles or allowing miners to front-run deposits with claims
