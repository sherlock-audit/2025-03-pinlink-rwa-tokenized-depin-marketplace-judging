# CentralizedOracle.sol introduces high Manipulation Risks

### Summary

The 7-day staleness threshold is extremely long for a price oracle, something that allows for significant market manipulation as prices could be severely outdated. Additionally, the price update is limited to 5x the initial price, restricting changes cause by high volatility 

### Root Cause

It's understandable if the implementation of the price feed Oracle isn't fully realized yet, but the groundwork implementation of [```STALENESS_THRESHOLD = 7 days```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L19), is dangerous.
Furthermore, the sanity checks performed inside ```updateTokenPrice```https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L52-L57
 limit the ability of the oracle to adapt to big price swings, cause by the market, to only up to 5x of the last price value.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Price is set to a starting value by the Oracle
2. Listings use this price reference

### External Pre-conditions

1. Users interact with the protocol
2. A user notices that prices aren't updated in time


### Attack Path

1. A malicious user has noticed the Oracle's issues
2. Proceeds to manipulate the market by timing their trades according to Oracle's updates and limitations
3. Profits off the unawareness of regular users

### Impact

The users experience significant loss.
