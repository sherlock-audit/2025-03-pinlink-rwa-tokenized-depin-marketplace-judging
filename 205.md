# The rewards system will inflate due to improper handling of subsequent deposits.

### Summary

The implementation in the `depositRewards` function in `streams.sol` will cause an inflation of the `globalRewardsPerStakedTarget` for users as subsequent calls to `depositRewards` will add to the existing delta instead of overwriting it, leading to insufficient rewards for later users.

### Root Cause

In `streams.sol`, the logic in the `depositRewards` function is adding `delta` to `globalRewardsPerStakedTarget` instead of replacing it, which inflates the rewards over time.

- In [`streams.sol:102`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L102), the line `self.globalRewardsPerStakedTarget += delta;` causes the inflation issue, as it adds the new delta to the existing total instead of resetting it.

In order for the operator to make subsequent depositRewards, the dripping period should have ended and the users would already have claimed all of the tokens eligible to them.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The `depositRewards` function must be called
2.  `drippingPeriod` should finish
3. Operator calls depositRewards

### External Pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. An admin calls `depositRewards` to deposit rewards into the system.
2. The `delta` is calculated and added to `globalRewardsPerStakedTarget`.
3. The admin calls `depositRewards` again after the `drippingPeriod` has finished, causing another `delta` to be added to `globalRewardsPerStakedTarget`.
4. This process continues, inflating the `globalRewardsPerStakedTarget` with each deposit.
5. When users attempt to claim rewards, the inflated `globalRewardsPerStakedTarget` results in insufficient rewards being distributed, as the calculations are based on an incorrect total.

### Impact

**Impact**: Users suffer from an inability to claim their expected rewards due to the inflation of the `globalRewardsPerStakedTarget`. This leads to frustration and a lack of trust in the rewards system, as newer users may find that their claims are insufficient or denied.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

**Mitigation**: Modify the `depositRewards` function to set `globalRewardsPerStakedTarget` to the new `delta` instead of adding to it. This will ensure that the rewards are calculated correctly and that users receive their fair share of rewards without inflation.
