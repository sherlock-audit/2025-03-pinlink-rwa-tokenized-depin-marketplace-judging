# Attacker can front-run oracle update to arbitrage prices

### Summary

An attacker can exploit the delay in oracle updates in mempool to manipulate asset prices, leading to arbitrage opportunities that can unfairly benefit the attacker.

### Root Cause

The system relies on an external oracle for pricing, but price updates are not synchronized with transaction execution, allowing front-running.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The protocol fetches the latest price from an oracle during buy/sell operations.

Oracle updates occur at set intervals (not per transaction).

### External Pre-conditions

The attacker has access to a mempool scanner (e.g., Flashbots, MEV searcher).

The attacker monitors oracle updates and predicts future price changes.

### Attack Path

- The attacker detects an upcoming oracle update that will increase the price of an asset.
- 
- Before the update is mined, they submit a buy transaction at the current lower price.
- 
- After the update is confirmed, they sell at a higher price, profiting from the difference.
- 
- This can be repeated whenever price discrepancies exist due to delayed oracle updates.

### Impact

Unfair arbitrage gains for attackers.

Protocol liquidity depletion.

Loss of user trust due to price manipulation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Price Commit-Reveal Mechanism: Implement a time delay for oracle price changes to prevent instant arbitrage.
- Mandatory Oracle Delay: Enforce a minimum time gap between price updates and transaction execution.
