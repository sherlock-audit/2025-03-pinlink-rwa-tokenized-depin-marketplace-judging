# Users can sandwich price updates to steal PIN from buyers

### Summary

In the `purchase` function of pinlinkShop.sol buyers can set the `maxTotalPinAmount` in order to prevent malicious sellers from frontrunning the purchase and increasing the price:

```solidity
        if (totalPinPayment > maxTotalPinAmount) revert SlippageExceeded();
```

 The issue is that this is unsefficient and malicious sellers are still able to steal from buyers.

### Root Cause

In the `purchase` function of pinlinkShop.sol the slippage protection makes sure that the buyer does not transfer more PIN than `maxTotalPinAmount`. The issue is that the price of PIN may increase right before the purchase occurs. As a result, the seller will be able to increase the `usdPricePerFraction` without causing their PIN payment to surpass `maxTotalPinAmount`. This will allow the seller to maliciously increase their PIN payment.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions needed.

### External Pre-conditions

The price of PIN must be updated right before the call to `purchase` is executed.

### Attack Path

1. A seller sells 10 fractional assets at 100 USD `usdPricePerFraction`, currently 1 PIN is equal to 1 USD

2. A buyers sends a transaction to buy the 10 assets with `maxTotalPinAmount` set to 100 PIN.

3. Right before the buyers transaction is executed the price of 1 PIN increases to 1.1 USD.

4. The buyer can now increase the `usdPricePerFraction` to 110 USD, because 110 USD will be converted to 100 PIN.

5. Finally the buyers transaction executes successfully as `maxTotalPinAmount` is not surpassed. However, the buyer has paid 110 USD for the assets, even though they initially intended for the maximum PIN payment to not be worth more than 100 USD.

### Impact

Sellers are able to steal from buyers.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider including another slippage protection parameter in `purchase` which makes sure that the PIN price has not increased over a certain value.
