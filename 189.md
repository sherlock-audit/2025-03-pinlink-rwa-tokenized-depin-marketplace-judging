# Sanity Check Logic Can Still Be Abused

Description
The CentralizedOracle contract includes sanity checks in the updateTokenPrice function to prevent extreme price changes. Specifically, the logic allows a maximum price increase of 5x and a maximum price drop of 80% per update. However, this logic can still be abused by a malicious owner who can manipulate the price gradually over multiple updates.

Impact
Gradual Price Manipulation: A malicious owner can manipulate the price gradually over multiple updates, leading to significant deviations over time.
Market Instability: Gradual price manipulation can cause market instability and loss of trust in the oracle.
Financial Losses: Users and protocols relying on the oracle for accurate price data may suffer financial losses due to manipulated prices.

Proof of Concept (PoC)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L52

Set Initial Price: Deploy the CentralizedOracle contract with an initial price.
Gradual Manipulation: The owner calls the updateTokenPrice function multiple times, each time increasing the price by 5x or decreasing it by 80%.
Observe Manipulation: Over multiple updates, the price deviates significantly from the true market value.

Exploit Scenario
The contract is deployed with an initial price of 1 USD.
The malicious owner gradually increases the price by 5x in each update, reaching an inflated price of 1,000,000 USD over multiple updates.
Users and protocols relying on the oracle for price data suffer financial losses due to the manipulated price.

Mitigation
Require Off-Chain Signed Data: Use off-chain signed data from trusted oracles to validate and update the price. This ensures that the price updates are accurate and not subject to manipulation by a single entity.
Implement Decentralized Oracles: Use decentralized oracles to aggregate price data from multiple sources, reducing the risk of manipulation by a single entity.
Code Example for Mitigation
Off-Chain Signed Data Implementation
```solidity
// ...existing code...
import {ECDSA} from "lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol";

contract CentralizedOracle is IPinlinkOracle, ERC165, Ownable {
    // ...existing code...

    address public oracleNode;

    constructor(address token_, uint256 initialPriceInUsd_, address _oracleNode) Ownable(msg.sender) {
        TOKEN = token_;
        oracleNode = _oracleNode;

        // ...existing code...
    }

    function updateTokenPrice(uint256 usdPerToken, bytes memory signature) external onlyOwner {
        bytes32 messageHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(usdPerToken));
        bytes32 ethSignedMessageHash = ECDSA.toEthSignedMessageHash(messageHash);
        address signer = ECDSA.recover(ethSignedMessageHash, signature);
        require(signer == oracleNode, "Invalid signature");

        _tokenPriceInUsd = usdPerToken;
        lastPriceUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        emit PriceUpdated(usdPerToken);
    }

    // ...existing code...
}
```
By implementing these mitigations, the contract can ensure that price updates are accurate and not subject to manipulation by a single entity, thereby maintaining market stability and trust in the oracle.
