# Lost Rewards When No Stakers Present

# Lost Rewards When No Active Stakers Present

## Summary

The `PinlinkShop` contract allows rewards to be deposited and distributed even when there are no active stakers in the system (i.e., when all tokens have been withdrawn). When this happens, the rewards are effectively lost as they are distributed to no one, and remain permanently locked in the contract. This creates a scenario where protocol funds can be irreversibly lost without benefiting any participants.

## Root Cause

The root cause lies in the `depositRewards` function in the `streams.sol` contract. When rewards are deposited, they are distributed based on the current staking balances without checking if there are any active stakers. While the contract ensures `assetSupply` is non-zero during asset enablement, it doesn't verify that there are currently staked tokens when rewards are deposited.

The issue occurs because:

1. The contract tracks total supply (`assetSupply`) separately from active staked balances
2. All tokens can be withdrawn while keeping `assetSupply` non-zero
3. The rewards calculation uses `assetSupply` without verifying active staked amounts

```solidity
function depositRewards(RewardsStream storage self, uint256 amount, uint256 drippingPeriod) internal {
    // ... validation checks ...

    // The rewards are distributed based on assetSupply
    // Even if all tokens are withdrawn, assetSupply remains non-zero
    uint256 delta = (amount * PRECISION) / self.assetSupply;

    self.globalRewardsPerStakedTarget += delta;
    self.deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked = delta;
    self.lastDepositTimestamp = block.timestamp;
    self.drippingPeriod = drippingPeriod;
}
```

The protocol cannot recover these lost reward tokens as the `rescueToken` function explicitly prevents rescuing the reward token:

```solidity
function rescueToken(address erc20Token, address to) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    if (erc20Token == address(REWARDS_TOKEN)) revert InvalidParameter();

    // PIN is not expected to stay in this contract balance, so it is ok to recover
    IERC20(erc20Token).safeTransfer(to, IERC20(erc20Token).balanceOf(address(this)));
}
```


## External Preconditions

- None. This is an internal protocol vulnerability that doesn't depend on external conditions.

## Initial Preconditions

1. An asset must be enabled in the protocol
2. The operator role must deposit rewards

## Attack Path

1. The operator deposits rewards during this period
2. The rewards are distributed but since there are no active stakers, they are effectively lost
3. Even when users stake again later, these lost rewards cannot be claimed
4. The rewards remain permanently locked in the contract with no mechanism to recover them

## Impact

**Severity: High**

The impact is considered High because:

1. Direct loss of protocol funds with no recovery mechanism
2. The lost rewards cannot be claimed by future stakers
3. The issue can occur repeatedly as long as there are periods with no active stakers
4. The protocol's reward distribution mechanism becomes unreliable

## Proof of Concept

```solidity
    function test_depositRewards_rewardsLostWithNoStakers() public {
        // First handle Alice's tokens
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        pshop.delist(listingId3, type(uint256).max);
        uint256 aliceBalance = _stakedBalance(address(fractions), asset1, alice);
        if (aliceBalance > 0) {
            pshop.withdrawAsset(address(fractions), asset1, aliceBalance, alice);
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Then handle Bob's tokens
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        uint256 bobBalance = _stakedBalance(address(fractions), asset1, bob);
        if (bobBalance > 0) {
            pshop.withdrawAsset(address(fractions), asset1, bobBalance, bob);
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Finally handle admin's tokens
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        pshop.delist(listingId0, type(uint256).max); // Delist all from first listing
        pshop.delist(listingId1, type(uint256).max); // Delist all from second listing
        uint256 adminBalance = _stakedBalance(address(fractions), asset1, admin);
        if (adminBalance > 0) {
            pshop.withdrawAsset(address(fractions), asset1, adminBalance, admin);
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Verify no stakers by checking total staked balance
        assertEq(_totalPendingRewards(address(fractions), asset1), 0);

        // Deposit rewards when there are no stakers
        uint256 rewardsAmount = 1000e6; // 1000 USDC
        vm.startPrank(operator);
        pshop.depositRewards(address(fractions), asset1, rewardsAmount, 6 hours);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Skip past dripping period
        skip(7 hours);

        // Now deposit tokens back and verify rewards were lost
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        fractions.setApprovalForAll(address(pshop), true);
        uint256 totalSupply = fractions.balanceOf(admin, asset1); // Get admin's balance since they have all tokens now
        pshop.depositAsset(address(fractions), asset1, totalSupply);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Check that admin gets no rewards despite being the only staker now
        assertEq(pshop.getPendingRewards(address(fractions), asset1, admin), 0);

        // The rewards are effectively lost as they were distributed when no one was staking
        assertEq(_totalPendingRewards(address(fractions), asset1), 0);
    }
```

## Mitigation

Recommended mitigations in order of preference:

1. Add a check for total active staked balance in `depositRewards`:

```solidity
function depositRewards(RewardsStream storage self, uint256 amount, uint256 drippingPeriod) internal {
    // ... existing checks ...

    // Calculate total active staked balance
    uint256 totalStaked = 0;
    // Note: In actual implementation, maintain a running total instead of iteration
    for (address staker in stakers) {
        totalStaked += self.stakedBalances[staker];
    }

    require(totalStaked > 0, "No active stakers");

    // Use totalStaked instead of assetSupply for reward distribution
    uint256 delta = (amount * PRECISION) / totalStaked;

    // ... rest of the function
}
```
