### Title
user can still claim pendingRewards even if user has withdrawn assets. pendingRewards of a user is not set to 0

## Description
According to the project’s documentation (README.md):

	“When assets are withdrawn, users lose their rights to rewards. These unassigned rewards can be collected by the OPERATOR role (trusted).”

However, the current implementation contradicts this requirement. When a user withdraws assets via withdrawAsset, the contract does not reset or reassign the user’s pendingRewards. Thus, the user retains the ability to claim previously accrued rewards even after fully withdrawing their stake.

Current Implementation:

When 'pinlinkShop.sol:withdrawAsset` is executed:
```solidity
function withdrawAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, address receiver) external {
    if (_nonListedBalance(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender) < amount) revert NotEnoughUnlistedTokens();

 @  streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(msg.sender, REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, amount);

    emit FractionsWithdrawn(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, receiver);
    IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(address(this), receiver, tokenId, amount, "");
}
```
It calls `streams.sol:transferBalances`, updating staked balances:
```solidity
function transferBalances(RewardsStream storage self, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
@   self.updateRewards(from);
      self.updateRewards(to); 
      self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount;
      self.stakedBalances[to] += amount;
}
```
`updateRewards(from)` increases the user’s `pendingRewards[from]` but does not reset it to zero after the balance is transferred. Thus, previously earned rewards remain accessible to the user even after withdrawing their stake.
The issue becomes evident when users call `pinlinkShop:claimRewards` post-withdrawal:
```solidity
function claimRewards(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId) external {
    uint256 claimed = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].claimRewards(msg.sender);
    if (claimed == 0) return;

    IERC20(REWARDS_TOKEN).safeTransfer(msg.sender, claimed);
    emit Claimed(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, claimed);
}
```
Here, the contract releases accumulated rewards incorrectly because it never nullified or reassigned the user’s pendingRewards.

Claimed amount is acquired using `streams.sol:claimRewards `function. Claimed amount will not be zero as pendingRewards is not set to zero during `streams.sol:updateRewards` function called within `streams.sol:claimRewards` . 

```solidity
    function updateRewards(RewardsStream storage self, address account) internal {
        uint256 globalPerStaked = self.globalRewardsPerStaked();
     @  self.pendingRewards[account] += self._pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate(globalPerStaked, account);
        self.updatedRewardsPerStaked[account] = globalPerStaked;
    }
```

Before withdraw account already had accumulated reward in self.pendingRewards[account]. Here, we can see that `self._pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate(globalPerStaked, account)` is added to `pendingRewards[account]`. `self._pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate(globalPerStaked, account)` will return 0 zero as self.stakedBalances[account] is set to 0 during transferBalances in withdrawAsset function. 

So, we can observe that anyone who withdraws their asset can claim rewards as pendingRewards of an account is not set to 0 or reassigned to `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT`



## Exploit Scenario
	1.	Alice stakes fractional assets.
	2.	Alice accumulates rewards (pendingRewards grows).
	3.	Alice withdraws all staked assets via withdrawAsset.
	4.	Alice’s stakedBalances[Alice] is set to zero, but pendingRewards[Alice] remains unchanged.
	5.	Alice calls claimRewards, receiving the rewards despite no longer holding any stake.
	
## Impact 
This allows users to incorrectly claim rewards after asset withdrawal, resulting in unexpected financial loss for the protocol and breaking the intended incentive logic.


## Recommendations
When an asset withdrawal happens, explicitly reset or reassign pendingRewards to prevent users from accessing these rewards. The safest method is to transfer any remaining pending rewards from the withdrawing user directly to the `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT`:
```solidity
function withdrawAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, address receiver) external {
    if (_nonListedBalance(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender) < amount) revert NotEnoughUnlistedTokens();

    RewardsStream storage stream = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId];

    // Claim and redirect user's pending rewards to REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT before withdrawal
    uint256 pending = stream.claimRewards(msg.sender);
   stream.claimRewards(msg.sender) = 0;
    if (pending > 0) {
        stream.pendingRewards[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT] += pending;
    }

    // Transfer balances
    stream.transferBalances(msg.sender, REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, amount);

    emit FractionsWithdrawn(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, receiver);
    IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(address(this), receiver, tokenId, amount, "");
}
```
