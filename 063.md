# Excessive Loop Iteration in `claimRewardsMultiple` will prevent users from claiming rewards

## Summary
An unbounded loop in the `claimRewardsMultiple` function will cause transactions to run out of gas when an excessively long array of token IDs is supplied. This will prevent users from successfully claiming rewards, leading to a denial‐of‐service (DoS) on reward claims.

## Root Cause
In [pinlinkShop.sol:_claimRewardsMultiple](https://github.com/your-repo-link) the function iterates over the entire array of token IDs provided by the caller without enforcing an upper limit.

```solidity
    /// @notice claims rewards for multiple assets and transfers them to the caller
    function claimRewardsMultiple(address fractionalAssets, uint256[] calldata tokenIds) external {
        uint256 totalClaimed;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
            // stream.claimRewards resets the rewards, so no harm in putting the same tokenId multiple times
            uint256 claimed = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenIds[i]].claimRewards(msg.sender);
            totalClaimed += claimed;
            // we emit here individual events for each tokenId for accountability reasons
            emit Claimed(fractionalAssets, tokenIds[i], msg.sender, claimed);
        }
        IERC20(REWARDS_TOKEN).safeTransfer(msg.sender, totalClaimed);
    }
```
**Issue:** No maximum limit on `tokenIds.length` allows an attacker (or even an unknowing user) to supply a very large array, causing the loop to consume excessive gas and ultimately revert.

## Internal Pre-conditions

1. Any address can call `claimRewardsMultiple` with an array of arbitrary length.
2. The function does not restrict the maximum number of token IDs processed.

## External Pre-conditions
1. An attacker (or a careless user) can submit a transaction with a very large `tokenIds` array.
2. The Ethereum block gas limit causes the transaction to revert if the array is too long.

## Attack Path
1. The attacker (or a malicious actor) calls `claimRewardsMultiple` with an excessively long array (e.g., 10,000 token IDs).
2. The loop iterates over all elements, consuming gas linearly.
3. The transaction exceeds the block gas limit and reverts, preventing reward claims.

## Impact
Affected users are unable to claim their rewards, which may disrupt market operations and erode user confidence. Repeated DoS conditions on reward claims could significantly harm platform usability.
- Gas consumption scales linearly with `tokenIds.length`. Each iteration involves:
   - `claimRewards` call (internal gas cost, potentially complex depending on RewardsStream logic).
   - Addition to `totalClaimed`.
   - Event emission (Claimed).
- Ethereum mainnet’s block gas limit (~30M gas) can be exceeded with a large array (e.g., thousands of token IDs), causing the transaction to revert.
- Users cannot claim rewards until they reduce the array size, effectively locking them out temporarily.

## PoC
**PoC Summary:**
This PoC simulates a DoS attack on the `claimRewardsMultiple` function by submitting an excessively large array of token IDs, leading to gas exhaustion and a revert.

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

import "./pinlinkShop.sol";

contract PoCClaimRewardsDoS {
    PinlinkShop public shop;

    constructor(address _shop) {
        shop = PinlinkShop(_shop);
    }

    function attack(address fractionalAssets) external {
        // Create an array with 10,000 token IDs
        uint256[] memory tokenIds = new uint256[](10000);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
            tokenIds[i] = i; // Arbitrary token IDs for simulation
        }
        // This call will iterate over 10,000 elements, likely exceeding the gas limit and reverting.
        shop.claimRewardsMultiple(fractionalAssets, tokenIds);
    }
}
```
**PoC Explanation:**
- The Bug:
The `claimRewardsMultiple` function does not restrict the length of the token IDs array. An excessively large array leads to a loop that consumes too much gas.

- How It Works:
For example, if the array contains 10,000 elements, the loop iterates 10,000 times. The gas cost grows linearly with the number of iterations, eventually exceeding the block gas limit.

- Attack Scenario:
An attacker calls `claimRewardsMultiple` with a crafted array of 10,000 token IDs. The loop’s execution causes the transaction to run out of gas and revert. As a result, legitimate reward claims fail, causing a DoS on the reward claim mechanism.

## Mitigation
- Limit Array Length: Add a require statement to enforce a maximum length on the `tokenIds` array. For example:
```solidity
require(tokenIds.length <= 100, "Too many token IDs");
```
- Batch Processing: Encourage users to split reward claims into multiple smaller transactions.
- Gas Optimizations: Consider optimizing the loop or using off-chain aggregation if applicable.
