# Price Manipulation Vulnerability in `updateTokenPrice` Through Sequential Updates

### Summary

The `updateTokenPrice` function contains a vulnerability that allows the owner to manipulate the token price beyond the intended limits by executing multiple sequential updates. While individual updates are restricted to a maximum of 5x increase, there's nothing preventing the owner from performing multiple updates in succession to achieve arbitrarily large price increases. Additionally, there is no time-based restriction between updates.


### Root Cause

The function implements price change limits through sanity checks that restrict single updates to within 1/5x and 5x of the current price. However, the function **lacks a cooldown period between updates**, allowing the owner to circumvent these restrictions by executing multiple sequential updates, each within the allowed range but collectively achieving a much larger price change than intended.

```solidity
    function updateTokenPrice(uint256 usdPerToken) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 _currentPrice = _tokenPriceInUsd;

        // sanity checks to avoid too large deviations caused by bot/human errors
        //@audit - can be avoided by calling the function multiple times
        if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
        if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();

        _tokenPriceInUsd = usdPerToken;
        lastPriceUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        // todo potential improvement. Everytime we update, we crosscheck the price with the Uniswap spot price
        //  - centralized, but controlled by a decentralized oracle, so that we can't manipulate it
        //  - cheaper to run than a TWAP oracle
        //  - less manipulable (except by us)


        emit PriceUpdated(usdPerToken);
    }
```

In the docs, clearly mentioned:

> The bot will only check every X minutes if price needs to be updated (X to be defined)
The bot only updates the price if it differs from the current oracle price in more than Y% (to be defined)

But there is no implementation in the function, which can be exploited by the malicious owner. I don't exactly know whether the above points are implemented externally and then calls function `updateTokenPrice`, but it is better to implement within the function itself, to avoid any edge cases

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Owner observes current token price is 10 USD
2. Owner calls updateTokenPrice(50) (5x increase, within allowed limits)
3. Token price is now 50 USD
4. Owner immediately calls `updateTokenPrice`(250) (5x increase from new price, within allowed limits)
5. Token price is now 250 USD
6. This can be repeated indefinitely to achieve arbitrary price increases

The same pattern could be used for price decreases as well (down to 1/5 of the original price per update).

### Impact

The severity of the bug is **HIGH**, because the impact is **CRITICAL** and likelihood in **LOW**. 
The function `updateTokenPrice` can only be called by the owner, so likelihood is LOW, as owner is trusted, but there is no problem in avoiding the edge case. So, I recommend to put a time restriction on updating the price

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Add a minimum time interval requirement between price updates:

```solidity
// Add this as a state variable
uint256 public constant PRICE_UPDATE_COOLDOWN = 24 hours;

function updateTokenPrice(uint256 usdPerToken) external onlyOwner {
    // Require minimum time since last update
    require(
        block.timestamp >= lastPriceUpdateTimestamp + PRICE_UPDATE_COOLDOWN,
        "Price update cooldown period not elapsed"
    );
    
    uint256 currentPrice = tokenPriceInUsd;
    // sanity checks to avoid too large deviations caused by bot/human errors
    if (usdPerToken < currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle_NewPriceTooLow();
    if (usdPerToken > currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle_NewPriceTooHigh();
    _tokenPriceInUsd = usdPerToken;
    lastPriceUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;
    emit PriceUpdated(usdPerToken);
}
```
