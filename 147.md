# Fees set to 0 will rever every PIN transaction in PinlinkShop

### Summary

purchaseFeePerc set to exactly 0 will cause reverting to every transaction using `_handlePayments`
[pinlinkShop.sol#L544](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/34cd70b66f1dbe191bd6f946e42f58eef4a00166/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L544)
### Root Cause

In PinkLink ERC20 is require check that wants every amount to be higher than zero.
```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) private {
        require(from != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
        require(to != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");
        require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions
