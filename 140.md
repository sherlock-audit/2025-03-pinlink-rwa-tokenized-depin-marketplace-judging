# Centralized oracle, stale price and frontrunning allow malicious buyer to pay much less PIN

### Summary

The project relies on a centralized oracle,According to the sherlock contest page, that's how the oracle will be managed:
_The price given by the CentralizedOracle will be set by a bot which checks the price from different sources (coingecko, Uniswap pool moving average, etc) and after some sanity checks it calls updateTokenPrice().
The bot will only check every X minutes if price needs to be updated (X to be defined)
The bot only updates the price if it differs from the current oracle price in more than Y% (to be defined)_

Front-running is still possible in case of extreme market fluctuations in less than 30 minutes, the project is deployed on Ethereum and it has public mempool.
Malicious buyers can take advantage of that when purchasing, they can end up sending much less `PIN` tokens to both the `seller` and `feeReceiver`.

### Root Cause

The choice of using a centralized oracle to get the price of `PIN` with no protection against front-running is a mistake.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `_tokenPriceInUsd` is still at `$3.8`
2. Seller deposits and lists by calling `depositAndList(...)`

### External Pre-conditions

1. actual `PIN` price dropped from `$3.8` to `$2.2`

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `getQuoteInTokens(...)` to be sure of this arbitrage opportunity
2. Attacker calls `purchase(...)` and gets the fractionalAssets at a discounted rate (50%)

The bot should have detected this price fluctuation to update the price, the malicious buyer can still front-run the call to `updateTokenPrice(...)` with a call to `purchase(...)`

### Impact

The difference between the actual price of `PIN` and that of the centralized oracle can incur in loss of funds for the protocol(`feeReceiver`) and the `seller`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a decentralized like chainlink with staleness checks and protecting against front-running is also advised.
