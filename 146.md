# Seller can list fractional assets without ownership verification

### Summary

A seller can list fractional assets without verifying they still own them, causing the listing to fail later due to insufficient balance. The root cause is the lack of validation in the `_list` function to ensure the seller has the required `_nonListedBalance` at the time of listing. This will cause a failed transaction for buyers or sellers as the listing creation does not enforce real-time ownership checks.

### Root Cause

In `PinlinkShop.sol`, the `_list` function does not validate the seller's current balance of fractional assets before creating a listing. Specifically, the function checks `_nonListedBalance` but does not ensure the seller still owns the required amount at the time of listing. This can lead to listings being created for assets the seller no longer owns.

```solidity
if (amount > _nonListedBalance(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender)) revert NotEnoughUnlistedTokens();
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The seller calls the `list` function to create a listing for a specific `fractionalAssets` and `tokenId`.
2. The seller's balance of the fractional asset decreases (e.g., due to a transfer or withdrawal) after the listing is created but before the purchase is executed.
3. A buyer attempts to purchase the listed assets, but the transaction fails due to insufficient seller balance.

### External Pre-conditions

The oracle must provide a valid price for the purchase to proceed.

### Attack Path

1. The seller calls the `list` function to create a listing for a specific `fractionalAssets` and `tokenId` with a certain amount.
2. After creating the listing, the seller transfers the listed assets to another address, reducing their balance.
3. A buyer calls the `purchase` function to buy the listed assets.
4. The transaction fails because the seller no longer has the required balance of the fractional asset.

### Impact

Affected Party: Buyers and sellers.

Impact: Buyers suffer a failed transaction and wasted gas. Sellers may lose trust in the marketplace due to unreliable listings.

Loss: Buyers lose gas fees, and the marketplace may suffer reputational damage.

### PoC

```solidity
// Assume:
// - Seller has 100 tokens of `fractionalAssets` with `tokenId = 1`.
// - Seller lists 100 tokens for sale.

// Step 1: Seller lists 100 tokens
seller.list(fractionalAssets, 1, 100, 1e18, block.timestamp + 1 days);

// Step 2: Seller transfers 100 tokens to another address
IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(seller, otherAddress, 1, 100, "");

// Step 3: Buyer attempts to purchase the listed tokens
buyer.purchase(listingId, 100, maxTotalPinAmount);

// Step 4: Transaction fails because the seller no longer has the tokens
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, the `_list` function should validate the seller's balance in real-time by ensuring the seller still owns the required amount of fractional assets at the time of listing. This can be done by checking the seller's balance directly from the fractional asset contract.
```solidity
function _list(
    address fractionalAssets,
    uint256 tokenId,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 usdPricePerFraction,
    uint256 deadline
) internal returns (bytes32 listingId) {
    // Check real-time balance of the seller
    uint256 sellerBalance = IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).balanceOf(msg.sender, tokenId);
    require(sellerBalance >= amount, "Not enough tokens in seller's balance");

    // Proceed with listing creation
    listingId = keccak256(
        abi.encode(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, amount, usdPricePerFraction, deadline, block.number)
    );

    require(amount > 0, "ExpectedNonZeroAmount");
    require(deadline > block.timestamp, "DeadlineHasExpiredAlready");
    require(usdPricePerFraction > 0, "ExpectedNonZeroPrice");
    require(_listings[listingId].seller == address(0), "ListingIdAlreadyExists");

    if (amount > _nonListedBalance(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender)) revert NotEnoughUnlistedTokens();

    // Register listing information
    _listings[listingId] = Listing({
        fractionalAssets: fractionalAssets,
        tokenId: tokenId,
        seller: msg.sender,
        amount: amount,
        usdPricePerFraction: usdPricePerFraction,
        deadline: deadline
    });

    _listedBalances[fractionalAssets][tokenId][msg.sender] += amount;

    emit Listed(listingId, msg.sender, tokenId, fractionalAssets, amount, usdPricePerFraction, deadline);
}
```
