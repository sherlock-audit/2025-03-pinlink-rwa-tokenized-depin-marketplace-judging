# missing by one error in the enable function.

### Summary

The enable function is missing by one in the require that validates the `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY` because the require is checking that the  `assetSupply < MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY` instead of `assetSupply <= MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY`, this won't allow to enable the maximum assets amount on any fractional assets.

### Root Cause

bad validation in the `require(assetSupply < MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh());` in the `enableAsset` function

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

NA

### Impact

The protocol cannot enable the maximum amount of assets (`MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY`) that should be allowed for any fractional asset in the `PinlinkShop` contract

### PoC

When the admin wants to enable a fractional asset in the `PinlinkShop` contract, he should call the `enableAsset` function from the `PinlinkShop` contract, this function calls the `enableAsset` function of the `StreamHandler` library, this function require that the `assetSupply` sent by the admin is greater than 0, and then check that the `assetSupply` is less than `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY`, but the MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY represent the maximum amount of assets that can be enable for a fractional asset, this is inclusive.

the current `require(assetSupply < MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh())` does not allow to set the assetSupply to the MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, so it's falling to include the last element.

additionally, I want to mention that the comment for the `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY` variable says that it should be equal to 1000, but it is actually been configured with a value of 1e4 = 10_000.

```solidity
    // The rewards are calculated dividing by the asset supply.
    // The larger the supply the larger the reminder, which is lost as rounding errors
    // with a supply of 1000, depositing 0.99$ will leave a max reminder of 0.0099999 $
    // (less than 1 cent lost in each rewards distribution)
    uint256 constant MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY = 1e4;
```

### Mitigation

change the require to:

```solidity
require(assetSupply <= MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh()); 
```
