# Fee Changes After Token Listing Result in Unexpected Seller Loss

### Summary

The pinlinkShop contract allows users to list tokens at a know fee percent. When a seller lists tokens for sale, they expect to receive a fixed return based on the current purchaseFeePerc. However, if the protocol updates the fee after the listing is created but before the purchase occurs, it is updated on all listed assets. the seller will unexpectedly pay a higher fee, reducing their earnings unfairly.

### Root Cause

The fee percentage should be locked at the time of listing to ensure sellers receive the expected amount.
If a fee update is required, it should only apply to new listings and not affect existing ones.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Seller lists tokens for sale, expecting to receive a know amount after fees (e.g., 950 PIN per 1000 PIN at a 5% fee).
Before the buyer purchases, the protocol increases the fee (e.g., from 5% to 10%).
The buyer purchases the token, and the seller now receives only 900 PIN instead of 950 PIN.
The seller loses additional tokens due to the fee change, which was not accounted for at the time of listing. 

### Impact

Sellers receive less than expected, leading to loss of trust in the platform.
Unfair financial disadvantage to sellers when fees increase.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

Store purchaseFeePerc at the time of listing and use that value for calculating seller payments.
Modify _handlePayments to use the stored fee rather than the current global fee.
