# Reentrancy bug in PinlinkShop.sol

**#Summary**

The depositAndList function in PinlinkShop.sol   is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it makes an external call (safeTransferFrom) before updating state variables.

**#Root cause**

The reentrancy vulnerability occurs in the depositAndList function (lines 368-377 in pinlinkShop.sol). The root cause is the violation of the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern.  The function makes an external call to IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom (line 531) before updating the contract's state. This external call transfers tokens from the caller (msg.sender) to the contract. After the external call, the function updates the state variables: _listedBalances (line 517), _listings (lines 508-515)
If the safeTransferFrom function calls back into the PinlinkShop contract (e.g., via a receive or fallback function in the caller's contract), the attacker can re-enter the depositAndList function before the state is updated. This allows the attacker to manipulate the contract's state or drain funds.

**#Attack Path**

1. Attacker Deploys Malicious Contract: The attacker deploys a contract with a receive or fallback function that calls back into PinlinkShop.

2. Attacker Calls depositAndList: The attacker calls depositAndList with a valid fractionalAssets address, tokenId, and amount.

3. Reentrancy Exploit: During the safeTransferFrom call, the attacker's contract re-enters depositAndList before the state is updated. The attacker repeats this process multiple times, listing the same tokens without updating the state.

4. Funds Stolen: The attacker withdraws the listed tokens, effectively stealing funds from the contract.

**#Impact**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to withdraw more funds than they deposited. For example, they could repeatedly call depositAndList before the state is updated, effectively listing the same tokens multiple times.

The attacker could manipulate the _listedBalances and _listings mappings, causing inconsistencies in the contract's state.
This could lead to incorrect listings, failed transactions, or other unintended behavior.

_Denial of Service (DoS):_
By repeatedly re-entering the function, the attacker could exhaust the contract's gas limit, causing transactions to fail and disrupting normal operations.

**#PoC**
So I fuzzed the smart contract through Slither which is where I noticed the behaviour 

Reentrancy in PinlinkShop.depositAndList(address,uint256,uint256,uint256,uint256) (pinlinkShop.sol#368-377):
        External calls:
        - _deposit(fractionalAssets,tokenId,amount) (pinlinkShop.sol#375)
                - IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender,address(this),tokenId,amount,) (pinlinkShop.sol#531)
        State variables written after the call(s):
        - listingId = _list(fractionalAssets,tokenId,amount,usdPricePerFraction,deadline) (pinlinkShop.sol#376)
                - _listedBalances[fractionalAssets][tokenId][msg.sender] += amount (pinlinkShop.sol#517)
        - listingId = _list(fractionalAssets,tokenId,amount,usdPricePerFraction,deadline) (pinlinkShop.sol#376)
                - _listings[listingId] = Listing({fractionalAssets:fractionalAssets,tokenId:tokenId,seller:msg.sender,amount:amount,usdPricePerFraction:usdPricePerFraction,deadline:deadline}) (pinlinkShop.sol#508-515)


**#Mitigation**

Update State Before External Calls: Move the state updates (_listedBalances and _listings) before the external call to safeTransferFrom.

Use a Reentrancy Guard: Apply a reentrancy guard (e.g., OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard) to prevent reentrant calls.
