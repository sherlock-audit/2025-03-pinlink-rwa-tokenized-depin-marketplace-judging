# Seller can still modify price of listed asset even after purchase

## Description
The current implementation of the purchase function allows a seller to modify the price of a listing even after some fractions have been purchased. This happens because the seller retains ownership of the listing and can call modifyListing at any time, changing the `usdPricePerFraction`. Since the purchase function dynamically references listing.usdPricePerFraction for price calculations, subsequent buyers may face unexpected price increases after the initial purchase. 
```solidity
    function modifyListing(bytes32 listingId, uint256 usdPricePerFraction, uint256 newDeadline)
        external
        onlySeller(listingId)
    {
@>        if (usdPricePerFraction > 0) {
            _listings[listingId].usdPricePerFraction = usdPricePerFraction;
            emit PriceUpdated(listingId, usdPricePerFraction);
        }
        if (newDeadline > 0) {
            require(newDeadline > block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());
            _listings[listingId].deadline = newDeadline;
            emit DeadlineExtended(listingId, newDeadline);
        }
    }
```

## POC
1. Seller list assets for sale 
2. A honest user buys the asset from seller
3. The honest purchaser tries to sell tokens to other users or back to seller
4. The seller observes this and modifies price to be cheap or very high to prevent sale
## Impact
Loss of funds for purchaser
## Recommended Mitigation
Transfer listing ownership or revoke ownership of the amount sold
