# pinlinkShop.sol-- Lack of access restrictions and flawed listing uniqueness logic allows malicious or duplicate listings

### Summary

The `_list()` function in the `PinlinkShop` contract uses `keccak256(abi.encode(...))` including `block.number` to enforce uniqueness of listing IDs. However, this approach is flawed:
 • Listings with the same parameters can be created across multiple blocks, defeating any protection against duplicate listings.
 • There’s no internal mechanism to prevent price manipulation or spam listings from the same seller across blocks.
 • No access throttling or limits on how frequently a seller can list assets.

Additionally, `_list()` can be called infinitely by the same seller, allowing a malicious actor to flood the system with listings differing only by block.number, making frontend filtering difficult and bloating storage.


### Root Cause

Line 496-498: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L496-L498

`listingId = keccak256(
  abi.encode(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, amount, usdPricePerFraction, deadline, block.number)
);`

 • block.number is used to force uniqueness, but allows nearly identical listings in adjacent blocks.
 • This makes `_list()` non-deterministic and bypassable for duplicate listing prevention.

There is no rate-limiting, cap per seller, or cooldown window, exposing the marketplace to:
 1. Listing spam
 2. Storage bloat
 3. Repeated listing manipulations



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Seller owns enough unlisted balances.
2. Asset is enabled in the ecosystem.
3. Listing inputs vary minimally (only by block.number or slight price variations).



### External Pre-conditions

1. A malicious seller automates listing calls every block.
2. Frontend depends on listing ID uniqueness without sanitizing duplicate content.
3. No frontend rate limit enforced either.


### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `depositAndList()` or `list()` with identical parameters in successive blocks.
2. Each time, listingId differs only due to `block.number`.
3. Listings are indistinguishable in practice but technically unique in contract storage.
4. User interface may render duplicates or fail to filter logically.
5. Marketplace becomes cluttered or vulnerable to DoS.



### Impact

• Spam attack vector: Contract allows infinite duplicate listings.
• Storage pollution: Listing storage bloats over time, increasing gas costs.
• UX degradation: Frontend struggles to differentiate listings.
• Market manipulation: Seller could list the same item at slightly varied prices to exploit buyers or distort pricing norms.



### PoC

// Assume these two are in back-to-back blocks
`pshop.list(asset, tokenId, 10, 1000e18, block.timestamp + 7 days);`
// next block
`pshop.list(asset, tokenId, 10, 1000e18, block.timestamp + 7 days);`

 • Both listings get different listingId only due to block.number.
 • No internal rejection for duplicates. Both listings are valid and active.



### Mitigation

• Remove block.number from `_list()` hash generation, and enforce uniqueness based on seller-token pair per unit time:

`bytes32 listingId = keccak256(
  abi.encode(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender)
);`

• Add mapping to prevent duplicate active listings:

`mapping(address => mapping(uint256 => bool)) public hasActiveListing;`
`require(!hasActiveListing[msg.sender][tokenId], "Duplicate listing");
hasActiveListing[msg.sender][tokenId] = true;`

 • Throttle listing frequency per seller or require listing overwrites instead of duplication.
 • Consider moving to incrementing nonce-based listing ID per seller, which scales better for UX and backend indexing.
