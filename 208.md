# STALENESS_THRESHOLD of 7 days is too long due to market volatility

### Summary

The oracle staleness check 
reverts to 0 if the price is stale (last update older than STALENESS_THRESHOLD) 
which is currently set to 7 days. 

However due to the volatility of crypto markets 7 days is long.

### Root Cause

```solidity

   uint256 public constant STALENESS_THRESHOLD = 7 days;

   if ((block.timestamp - lastPriceUpdateTimestamp) > STALENESS_THRESHOLD) {
```

### Impact

Outdated Prices:

Cryptocurrency prices can change significantly within hours or days. A 7-day threshold means the oracle could provide prices that are completely outdated.

For example, if the price of the token drops by 50% in 1 day, the oracle could continue providing the old price for up to 6 more days.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

change the STALENESS_THRESHOLD to 1 day
 
`uint256 public constant STALENESS_THRESHOLD = 1 days;`
