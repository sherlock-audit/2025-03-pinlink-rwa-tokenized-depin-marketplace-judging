# Fees do not respect seller slippage price

### Summary

When a seller lists shares for sale, the value that they're eventually given does not match their slippage specification


## Root Cause

Fees are removed from the total sale cost, rather than the total sale cost being increased to accomodate the fees.

When it comes to DEXs, an exchange will re-calculate the fill price based on the inclusion of fees. A concrete example is all [ERC-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) vaults that implement a fee, where all of the `preview*()` and `deposit()`/`mint()`/`withdraw()`/`redeem()` functions MUST _include_ the fees in the calculation, so that slippage can easily be respected (e.g. for `previewWithdraw()` `MUST be inclusive of withdrawal fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of withdrawal fees.`). See the OZ 4626 fee [guide](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc4626#fees).

Since this project is a DEX that uses a limit/slippage price, and there is no way in the contract to account for the fee when executing the trade, fees must be added on top to the total price instead.


## Internal Pre-conditions

1. Seller lists shares with a specific price, based on the currently-prevailing protocol fee (e.g. 0%)
2. The admin changes the protocol fee (e.g. to 10%) - can happen unintentionally in the same block as the listing due to accidental back-running, or any time after


## External Pre-conditions

## Attack Path

A buyer purchases shares from the listing after the fee change


## Impact

The seller's listing price will no longer be correct, and they'll have sold shares at a 10% loss (assuming the fee was changed from 0% to 10%)

All sellers will have to de-list and re-list at new prices that account for the higher fees

If the fees are reduced, sellers will likewise have to change their prices, or risk missing out to later listers that correctly price based on the new fee rate.


## PoC

The total payment is calculated prior to the inclusion of fees:
```solidity
// File: src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol : PinlinkShop.purchase()   #1

313 @>         uint256 totalUsdPayment = listing.usdPricePerFraction * fractionsAmount;
314            uint256 totalPinPayment = IPinlinkOracle(oracle).convertFromUsd(address(PIN), totalUsdPayment);
...
319            // transfers the payment to the seller and the fees to the feeReceiver
320            // note: ERC20 with callbacks (ERC777) are not supported, so the following should be safe
321:@>         (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees) = _handlePayments(msg.sender, seller, totalPinPayment);
```

The fees are subtracted from the total, without adjusting for the limit price, and there is no slippage check:
```solidity
// File: src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol : PinlinkShop._handlePayments()   #2

534        function _handlePayments(address buyer, address seller, uint256 totalPinPayment)
535            internal
536            returns (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees)
537        {
538            // fees are rounded in favor of the protocol
539 @>         paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
540 @>         fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;
541    
542            // no need to verfy that msg.value==0, because purchases with tokens are done with purchaseWithToken() which is non-payable
543            IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, paymentForSeller);
544            IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, feeReceiver, fees);
545:       }
```

A seller selling a listing for $100 per fraction will only get $90 per fraction when the fee changes from 0% to 10%


## Mitigation

Back the fee into the `totalPinPayment` so that slippage is respected, or store the current fee during the `list()`/`modifyListing()`/`depositAndList()` operations
