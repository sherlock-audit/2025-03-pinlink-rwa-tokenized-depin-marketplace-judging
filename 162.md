# The `enableAsset()` will revert if `assetSupply` = 10000 is passed, but this value should be allowed as it is equal to `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY`

### Summary

The function [enableAsset()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L64-L72) is called internally by the `enableAsset()`  defined in the pinlinkShop.sol contract, it is the first step in the process, to bring a fractional asset token into the marketplace by enabling it, and later listing it to be traded by users.

It is called by admin based on number of FractionalAsset tokens that were minted initially.

```solidity
       uint256 assetSupply = IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).totalSupply(tokenId);
       stream.enableAsset(assetSupply, receiver);
```

The developer has specified that the assetSupply range can be [1,10000] in the [streams.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L47) contract.

But due to a slight error in use of relational operator in the `require` statement, this will revert, if the `assetSupply = 10000` the number of fraction shares for a tokenId  that were originally minted for the purpose of being included in the marketplace, post enabling by the admin.

```solidity
  uint256 constant MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY = 1e4;
  
//code

    function enableAsset(RewardsStream storage self, uint256 assetSupply, address receiver) internal {
        require(assetSupply > 0, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyIsZero());
@>   require(assetSupply < MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh());
        // At the beginning, all supply starts earing rewards for the receiver until purchased (admin account)
        self.updateRewards(receiver);
        self.stakedBalances[receiver] += assetSupply;
        // assetSupply is immutable so the following field cannot be modified ever again
        self.assetSupply = assetSupply;
    }

```

when assetSupply = 10000, the above require statement will check if 10000 < 10000, since this will be false, and the function will revert with following error statement. `PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh())`, but as the assetSupply maximum value can not exceed the `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY` (1e4).

### Root Cause

A slight error in use of relational operator in the `require` statement, this will revert, if the `assetSupply = 10000` the number of fraction shares for a tokenId  that were originally minted for the purpose of being included in the marketplace, post enabling by the admin.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. When the admin calls the `enableAsset()` for a fractional asset tokenId, with the totalSupply being `10000`, the code will revert, stating that the Asset_supply is too high, but in fact the asset supply is equal to max_asset_supply allowed value.  

### Impact

Intended assetSupply = 1e4, is not actually possible for any fractional asset tokenId's as it was intended to have a max assetSupply = 1e4.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make the following changes in the [enableAsset()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L64-L72) function:

```diff
    function enableAsset(RewardsStream storage self, uint256 assetSupply, address receiver) internal {
        require(assetSupply > 0, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyIsZero());
-      require(assetSupply < MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh());
+     require(assetSupply <= MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh());
        // At the beginning, all supply starts earing rewards for the receiver until purchased (admin account)
        self.updateRewards(receiver);
        self.stakedBalances[receiver] += assetSupply;
        // assetSupply is immutable so the following field cannot be modified ever again
        self.assetSupply = assetSupply;
    }
```
