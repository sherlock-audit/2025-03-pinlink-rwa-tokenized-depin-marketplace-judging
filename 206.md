# Incorrect usage of Ownable inheritance and constructor

From the overall review, this contract has several potential logical vulnerabilities or design flaws. A common and critical issue is as follows:

## Incorrect usage of `Ownable` inheritance and constructor

The provided contract uses a constructor as follows:

```solidity
constructor(address token_, uint256 initialPrice_) Ownable(msg.sender) {
    TOKEN = token_;
    ...
}
```

However, **the standard OpenZeppelin `Ownable` contract doesn't have a constructor accepting arguments**. The standard `Ownable` constructor signature provided by OpenZeppelin is:

```solidity
constructor() {
    _transferOwnership(_msgSender());
}
```

This means your current constructor syntax (`Ownable(msg.sender)`) does **not exist** in standard OpenZeppelin implementations.  
The correct way to handle ownership initialization is either:

```solidity
constructor(address token_, uint256 initialPrice_) {
    TOKEN = token_;
    _transferOwnership(msg.sender);
}
```

Or explicitly inherit the parameterless `Ownable()` constructor and set ownership manually within your own constructor:

```solidity
constructor(address token_, uint256 initialPrice_) Ownable() {
    TOKEN = token_;
    _transferOwnership(msg.sender);
}
```
