# Incorrect logic in `withdrawAsset` can lead to wrong updation of `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` and incorrect reward amount claim via `claimUnassignedRewards`.

## Summary

When `withdrawAsset` is called, the staking balance of `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` is updated as follow -
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L352
```js
    function withdrawAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, address receiver) external {
        if (_nonListedBalance(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender) < amount) revert NotEnoughUnlistedTokens();

        // this does't transfer the assets, but only the internal accounting of staking balances
@1>     streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(msg.sender, REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, amount);

        emit FractionsWithdrawn(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, receiver);
        IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(address(this), receiver, tokenId, amount, "");
    }
```
```js
    function transferBalances(RewardsStream storage self, address from, address REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, uint256 amount) internal {
        self.updateRewards(from);
@2>     self.updateRewards(REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT);
        self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount;
@3>     self.stakedBalances[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT] += amount;
    }
```
`self.updateRewards()` ->
```js
    function updateRewards(RewardsStream storage self, address account) internal {
        uint256 globalPerStaked = self.globalRewardsPerStaked();
@4>     self.pendingRewards[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT] += self._pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate(globalPerStaked, REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT);
        self.updatedRewardsPerStaked[account] = globalPerStaked;
    }
```
`self._pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate()` ->
```js
    function _pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate(RewardsStream storage self, uint256 globalPerStaked, address REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {

        return (self.stakedBalances[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT] * (globalPerStaked - self.updatedRewardsPerStaked[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT])) / PRECISION;
    }
```
Suppose there are 3 updates on `globalPerStaked`.

1. suppose pending reward of userA is `self.pendingRewards[userA] = A + B + C` before withdrawing any assets. where `A` is reward accumulated on first `globalPerStaked` update, `B` is reward accumulated in second `globalPerStaked` update and `C` is reward accumulated in third `globalPerStaked` update. and his staked balance is `X`.
2. And this reward must be transfered to `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` if not claimed.
3. suppose userA didn't claimed his reward and called `withdrawAsset`.
4. as mentioned with `@4>`the  `self.pendingRewards[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT]` will be 0. as `self.stakedBalances[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT]` will be 0. (because it's the 1st withdrawel in protcol).
5. Then, stakeBalance of `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` will be updated at `@3>` by `X` as `self.stakedBalances[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT] = X` .
6. Now admin calls `claimUnassignedRewards` -
```js
    function claimUnassignedRewards(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, address to)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
    {
        uint256 claimed = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].claimRewards(REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT);
        if (claimed == 0) return;

        IERC20(REWARDS_TOKEN).safeTransfer(to, claimed);
        emit Claimed(fractionalAssets, tokenId, to, claimed);
    }
```

```js
    function claimRewards(RewardsStream storage self, address account) internal returns (uint256 claimed) {
        self.updateRewards(account);
        claimed = self.pendingRewards[account];
        delete self.pendingRewards[account];
    }
```
7. Again the same flow -

`self.updateRewards()` ->
```js
    function updateRewards(RewardsStream storage self, address account) internal {
        uint256 globalPerStaked = self.globalRewardsPerStaked();
@5>     self.pendingRewards[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT] += self._pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate(globalPerStaked, REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT);
        self.updatedRewardsPerStaked[account] = globalPerStaked;
    }
```
`self._pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate()` ->
```js
    function _pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate(RewardsStream storage self, uint256 globalPerStaked, address REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {

@6>      return (self.stakedBalances[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT] * (globalPerStaked - self.updatedRewardsPerStaked[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT])) / PRECISION;
    }
```
8. The pending reward of `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` will be non-zero this time, it will be [`0` (see point 4) + `C` (see point 1)]. because in current implementation, the pending reward `A` and `B` is not taken into consideration.

9. Hence, unassigned reward being claimed by admin will be only `C`, though it's expected to claim `A + B + C` amount. causing loss of `A + B` reward amounts.


## Root Cause
proper accounting from `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` stakeBalance isn't done.
## Internal Pre-Condition
- It should be first withdrawal from protcol, to make sure `self.stakedBalances[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT]` is 0.
- there should more than 1 `depositRewards` by admin or multiple dripping periods. let's say 3 updates.

## Attack Path
Same as above.
## Impact
The unassigned reward that's being claimed is only considering the reward accumuated between current `globalPerStaked` value and previous `globalPerStaked` value. It's not not considering the reward accumulated through all `globalPerStaked` changes. this will lead to less unassigned reward being claimed by admin. 

## Mitigation
There is need to implement proper logic, to updated the pending reward for `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` accumulated during all previous updatetion of `globalPerStaked`, not just between current and previous value.
