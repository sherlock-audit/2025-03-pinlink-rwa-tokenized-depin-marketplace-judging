# Rounding Bug will cause Accounting Discrepancy for PinlinkShop Contract

## Summary
Truncated reward calculations in the PinlinkShop contract will cause an accounting anomaly for contract USDC balances as the reward mechanism discards fractional rewards. Over many reward cycles, these unassigned fractions (dust) accumulate, leading to a permanent discrepancy between the USDC balance and the sum of pending rewards.

## Root case
In the [marketplace-contracts project](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/tree/main/marketplace-contracts) the reward distribution mechanism truncates fractional parts during the calculation of `deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked`. This design choice causes any fraction of a reward (estimated to be less than $0.01 per deposit) to be discarded. Moreover, the rescueToken function explicitly prohibits the admin from withdrawing USDC, preventing any recovery of these residual amounts. Consequently, these tiny amounts accumulate permanently on the contract, creating an accounting anomaly.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. A reward deposit is processed where the reward amount contains fractional values.
2. The reward calculation truncates the fractional component (i.e., rounds down) during the computation of `deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked`.
3. Numerous reward cycles occur, allowing the truncated fractions (dust) to accumulate.
4. The `rescueToken` function prohibits the admin from withdrawing USDC beyond the pending rewards.

##External Pre-conditions
No changes or fluctuations in external protocols are required; the issue stems solely from the internal reward distribution logic.

##Attack path
1. A user deposits a reward into the contract, triggering the reward distribution mechanism.
2. The calculation of deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked truncates any fractional reward amounts.
3. These discarded fractions accumulate in the contract's USDC balance as dust.
4. Over many cycles, the cumulative dust increases the contract's USDC balance beyond the sum of pending rewards.
5. The rescueToken function blocks any attempt by the admin to withdraw the surplus USDC, leaving the dust permanently locked.

## Impact
The contract exhibits an accounting discrepancy where the cumulative USDC balance may slightly exceed the total pending rewards allocated to users and proxy. Although the individual discrepancy per deposit is minor (typically less than $0.01), over time the accumulated dust could complicate balance audits and financial reconciliations, potentially leading to confusion among auditors and stakeholders.

## PoC
- Step 1: Initiate multiple reward cycles with deposits that include fractional reward amounts.
- Step 2: Observe that in each cycle, the reward distribution calculation truncates the fractional part.
- Step 3: Verify that the USDC balance on the contract gradually increases due to the accumulation of dust.
- Step 4: Confirm that the pending rewards do not reflect the additional USDC balance.
- Step 5: Attempt to withdraw the excess USDC via rescueToken and note that the operation is blocked.

##Mitigation
1. Alternative Rounding: Adjust the reward distribution mechanism to use a rounding strategy that minimizes the loss of fractional amounts (e.g., rounding to the nearest integer) or accumulates the fractions more precisely.
2. Enhanced Rescue Function: Modify the rescueToken function to allow the admin to withdraw USDC amounts exceeding the pending rewards, thereby enabling recovery of the accumulated dust.
