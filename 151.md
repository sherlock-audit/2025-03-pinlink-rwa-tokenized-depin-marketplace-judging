# Malicious users will prevent legitimate users from claiming rewards in bulk via unbounded loop DoS attack

### Summary

The lack of array size limit in claimRewardsMultiple will cause a denial of service for legitimate users as malicious actors will submit excessively large token arrays that exceed block gas limits, rendering the function unusable for bulk reward claims.
```solidity
    function claimRewardsMultiple(address fractionalAssets, uint256[] calldata tokenIds) external {
        uint256 totalClaimed;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
            // stream.claimRewards resets the rewards, so no harm in putting the same tokenId multiple times
            uint256 claimed = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenIds[i]].claimRewards(msg.sender);
            totalClaimed += claimed;
            // we emit here individual events for each tokenId for accountability reasons
            emit Claimed(fractionalAssets, tokenIds[i], msg.sender, claimed);
        }
        IERC20(REWARDS_TOKEN).safeTransfer(msg.sender, totalClaimed);
    }
```

### Root Cause

In [pinlinkShop.sol:337-345](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L337C6-L337C38) the function claimRewardsMultiple iterates through an unbounded array of tokenIds without any limit on array size, allowing users to submit arrays that consume more gas than the block limit allows.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The protocol needs to have multiple assets (tokenIds) enabled and generating rewards
2. Users need to own fractions of multiple assets to make the claimRewardsMultiple function desirable

### External Pre-conditions

None specifically required. The attack works regardless of market conditions or external protocols.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates an array with many tokenIds (e.g., 1000+) i.e. buys a big number of fractions with very low price
2. Attacker calls claimRewardsMultiple with this array
3. Transaction execution consumes gas for each tokenId in the loop
4. Gas consumption exceeds block gas limit (typically ~30M on Ethereum)
5. Transaction fails but makes the function unusable for legitimate users
6. Attacker can repeat this attack continuously at minimal cost

### Impact

The affected users cannot claim rewards in bulk across multiple assets, forcing them to claim one by one at significantly higher total gas cost. Protocol operations are severely disrupted as institutional users, asset managers, and service providers cannot efficiently manage rewards across multiple assets. This can also indirectly affect PIN token price by artificially suppressing reward claims and reducing market liquidity.

The attack is especially concerning because it doesn't require malicious intent - even legitimate users trying to claim across many assets would trigger the issue. As the protocol scales, this vulnerability could completely block a core function. 

Potential impact if exploited: 
- Competitive disruption
- After demonstrating the vulnerability, attackers could demand payment to stop the attacks.
- Force users to claim rewards individually (through claimRewards) - not really doable for large holders, DAOs, institutions holding many itmes
- Reputation damage



### PoC

```solidity
    function testGasLimitExceededInClaimRewardsMultiple() public {
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            fractions.mint(i, admin, 100);
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(admin);
        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            fractions.setApprovalForAll(address(pshop), true);
            pshop.enableAsset(address(fractions), i, admin);
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(operator);
        for (uint256 i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
            pshop.depositRewards(address(fractions), i, 100e6, 6 hours);
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        skip(10 hours);

        // Create a large array of tokenIds (reduced to 100 for testing)
        // In production, users could create much larger arrays
        uint256[] memory tokenIds = new uint256[](100);
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            tokenIds[i] = i + 1;
        }

        vm.prank(alice);
        uint256 gasStart = gasleft(); // gas consumption
        pshop.claimRewardsMultiple(address(fractions), tokenIds);
        uint256 gasUsed = gasStart - gasleft();

        console.log("Gas used for 100 token claims: ", gasUsed);  // 3104520 gas during testing
        uint256 estimatedGasFor1000 = gasUsed * 10;  // estimating gas for 1000 tokens
        console.log("Estimated gas for 1000 tokens: ", estimatedGasFor1000); // 31045200 gas during testing
        console.log("Block gas limit: ", block.gaslimit);

        assertGt(
            estimatedGasFor1000,
            block.gaslimit / 2,  // ~15M is a reasonable checkpoint
            "Gas usage would be too high for real-world use with 1000 tokens"
        );
    }
```

### Mitigation

Add a reasonable limit to the array size in the claimRewardsMultiple function - pass a value to the function. for optimization could pop the elements to save some gas once claimed.
