# Partial Payment Issue in _handlePayments()

### Summary

The _handlePayments() function processes two separate token transfers:

Seller’s payment
Protocol fee payment
If the buyer has enough allowance for paymentForSeller but not for the protocol fee, the seller's payment succeeds, but the fee transfer fails. This results in an inconsistent state where:

The seller receives funds, but
The protocol loses its expected fee revenue.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts\src\marketplaces\pinlinkShop.sol#L544-L545

A buyer approves only paymentForSeller but not the total amount including fees.
The buyer purchases a listed token.
The first transfer (seller's payment) executes successfully.
The second transfer (protocol fee) fails due to insufficient allowance.
The seller receives funds, but the protocol loses fees.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Loss of Protocol Revenue
Malicious buyers can intentionally approve only the seller’s payment while leaving the fee unpaid.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

This ensures the buyer has enough tokens and allowance before any transfer occurs.
Pre-check total allowance and balance before executing transfers
