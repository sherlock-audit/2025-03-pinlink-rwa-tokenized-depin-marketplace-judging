# Sellers Receive Incorrect Payment Due to Faulty Fee Calculation

### Summary


An incorrect fee calculation in the `_handlePayments` function causes sellers to receive less than the expected amount for their assets. The fee is deducted from the seller's share instead of being added to the buyer's total payment, resulting in a loss for the seller equivalent to the protocol's fee percentage.


### Root Cause

In `PinlinkShop.sol`, the `_handlePayments` function 

```solidity
    function _handlePayments(address buyer, address seller, uint256 totalPinPayment)
        internal
        returns (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees)
    {
        // fees are rounded in favor of the protocol
        paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
        fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;

        // no need to verfy that msg.value==0, because purchases with tokens are done with purchaseWithToken() which is non-payable
        IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, paymentForSeller);
        IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, feeReceiver, fees);
    }
```

calculates the seller's payment by subtracting the fee from the total payment amount. This logic is flawed because the fee should be added to the buyer's payment to ensure the seller receives the correct amount.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1.  The `purchaseFeePerc` is set to a non-zero value (e.g., the default 500, representing 5%).
2.  A buyer initiates a `purchase` transaction for a listing.


### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path


1.  A seller lists an asset for sale.
2.  A buyer purchases the asset, triggering the `purchase` function.
3.  Within the `purchase` function, the `_handlePayments` function is called to distribute the payment between the seller and the fee receiver.
4.  The `_handlePayments` function calculates `paymentForSeller` by subtracting the `fees` from the `totalPinPayment`:

    ```solidity
    paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
    fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;
    ```

5.  This calculation effectively reduces the seller's payment by the fee amount, instead of increasing the buyer's total payment to account for the fee.
6.  The seller receives less PIN tokens than expected, while the fee receiver receives the correct fee amount. The buyer pays the intended `totalPinPayment` amount.



### Impact


The seller receives a reduced payment for their asset, losing a percentage of their expected revenue equal to the protocol's fee percentage. For example, with a 5% fee, the seller receives only 95% of the intended payment. The protocol benefits unfairly at the expense of the sellers.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Modify the `_handlePayments` function to add the fee to the buyer's total payment, ensuring the seller receives the correct amount:
