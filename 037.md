# Deposit will DOS if staked balance of `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` is less than deposit amount.

## Summary

The depositAsset function is as follow -
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L364
```js
    function depositAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external {
        _deposit(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount);
    }
```
```js
    function _deposit(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) internal {
        // it is only possible to deposit in already enabled assets in the ecosystem
        if (!streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].isEnabled()) revert AssetNotEnabled();

@>      streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, msg.sender, amount);

        emit FractionsDeposited(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, msg.sender);
        IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId, amount, "");
    }

```
```js
    function transferBalances(RewardsStream storage self, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        self.updateRewards(from);

        self.updateRewards(to);
@>      self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount;
        self.stakedBalances[to] += amount;
    }
```
If `self.stakedBalances[from]` is less than amount, then it will revert leading to DOS.

## Root Cause
Transfering stakes from `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` is wrong, the purpose of `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` is to deal with unassigned reward.

## Internal Pre-Condition
- There is no prior withdrawels yet
- Frequency of withdrawel is less than deposits.
## External Pre-Condition
## Attack Path
1. A user tries to deposit a amount greater than `self.stakedBalances[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT]`.
2. It will revert due to -
```js
self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount;
```
## Impact
Leading to DOS of depositAssset Function. Also REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT balance updation depends on mercy of Withdraw asset function call, if that's not called or called very less time as compared to deposit function then, then this current architcture will lead to DOS.
## PoC
## Mitigation
Implement new approch of staking removing `streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, msg.sender, amount);` from `_deposit` function.
