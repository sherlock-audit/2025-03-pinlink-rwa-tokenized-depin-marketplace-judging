# `claimUnassignedRewards` can be sandwitched between `depositAsset` and `WithdrawAsset` functions.

## Summary

An attacker can frontrun `claimUnassignedRewards` function, to reduce the value of staked balance of `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT`-
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L77
```js
self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount;
```
As the function flow is -
`depositAsset` -> `_deposit` -> `transferBalances` ->
```js
    function transferBalances(RewardsStream storage self, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        self.updateRewards(from);
        self.updateRewards(to);
@->     self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount;
        self.stakedBalances[to] += amount;
    }
```

## Attack Path
1. The admin calls `claimUnassignedRewards` function.
2. Attcker sees this in mem-pool. frontrun the tx with `depositAsset`, this will reduce the staked amount of `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT`
3. After that attacker withdraws asset by calling `WithdrawAsset`. restoring staked value of `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` to it's original value.
## Impact
The unassigned reward claimed will be less or 0, hence manipulation could easily be done on `claimUnassignedRewards` leadind to loss of admin/protocol.

## Mitigation
In `withdrawAsset` and `depositAsset` functions remove logic associated with `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT`.
