# [High] Front running (even unintentional) of centralized oracle update would lead into the seller being accredited less USD value than expected after a sale

### Summary

In PinlinkShop.sol, purchase function performs oracle checks at the moment of the purchase, comparing the PIN price to USD and so determining the final amount of PIN needed to perform the purchase. 
In a highly volatine market, during a price drop of PIN token price, users can unintentionally front-run oracle updates leading to better purchase rates than correct ones, potentially causing a significant final loss to the seller.
These updates can even be maliciously front-runned by mempool observers, who can make several trades at a premium causing substancial losses to all sellers.

### Root Cause

The choice of using PIN token with usd only buyer-side slippage protection in terms of maximum PIN opens up a volatility problem which can harm the seller.

function purchase(bytes32 listingId, uint256 fractionsAmount, uint256 maxTotalPinAmount) external {
        // ... existing validation

        // Calculate USD value of purchase
        uint256 totalUsdPayment = listing.usdPricePerFraction * fractionsAmount;
        
        // Convert USD amount to PIN using oracle (this is the critical oracle check)
        uint256 totalPinPayment = IPinlinkOracle(oracle).convertFromUsd(address(PIN), totalUsdPayment);

        // Oracle price validation
        if (totalPinPayment == 0) revert StaleOraclePrice();
        if (totalPinPayment > maxTotalPinAmount) revert SlippageExceeded();

    // ... rest of function
} 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Seller lists an asset with a USD price
2. The listing has no mechanism to protect the seller against PIN price fluctuations
3. Only the buyer has slippage protection via maxTotalPinAmount

### External Pre-conditions

1. An oracle update for PIN token is about to occur
2. PIN token price changes substantially relative to USD
3. Normal market activity occurs around the time of oracle updates

### Attack Path

1. Regular market participants submit purchase transactions shortly before an oracle update
2. These transactions naturally execute before the oracle update (unintentional front-running)
3. Purchases execute at the pre-update exchange rate
4. Oracle update executes, changing the PIN/USD rate
5. Sellers receive fewer PIN tokens than the expected market value of their assets

### Impact

Sellers can suffer an approximate loss of 10-30% of the intended value of their assets during high price volatility periods. This creates an unfair marketplace where sellers bear all the risk of price fluctuations, while buyers are fully protected through their slippage parameters. Even without malicious intent, this structural imbalance leads to value extraction from sellers during normal market operations.

### PoC

Add this runnable PoC to purchase.t.sol


    function test_purchaseOracleUpdateFrontRun() public {
        address buyer = makeAddr("buyer");
        uint256 asset4 = 444;
    
        deal(address(PIN), buyer, 10_000_000e18);
        //set original pin price to 1.5 dollars
        vm.startPrank(admin);
        //clear admin initial PIN balance
        PIN.transfer(address(0xdead), PIN.balanceOf(admin));
        oracle.updateTokenPrice(1.5 ether);
        // minting asset4 to admin and enabling it to be tradeable
        fractions.mint(asset4, admin, 100);
        pshop.enableAsset(address(fractions), asset4, admin);
        //setting fees to 10 percent
        pshop.setFee(1000);
    
        //creating a listing for 10 fractions at 100 dollars each
        listingId4 = pshop.list(address(fractions), asset4, 10, 100e18, block.timestamp + 12 days);
        vm.stopPrank();
        // buy transaction that unintentionally front runs the oracle update
        vm.startPrank(buyer);
        PIN.approve(address(pshop), type(uint256).max);
        pshop.purchase(listingId4, 10, 1500e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
    
        uint256 expectedFinalBalanceInUsd = oracle.convertToUsd(address(PIN), PIN.balanceOf(admin));
    
        // oracle price update with a sharp decrease of PIN token price (highly volatile market)
        vm.prank(admin);
        oracle.updateTokenPrice(1 ether);
    
        //User's current value in usd after the sale
        uint256 sellerBalanceInUsd = oracle.convertToUsd(address(PIN), PIN.balanceOf(admin));
        assertLt(sellerBalanceInUsd, expectedFinalBalanceInUsd);
    }

### Mitigation

Different scenarios:
1. A potential recommendation would be relying on an escrow for the trades, ensuring that the seller always receives his wanted value even in a volatile market.
2. Adding an option during Listing that gives the seller the ability to choose on which token he wants the payment to be accredited, with a stablecoin option, the admins would have to handle the exchange from PIN to stablecoin during the purchase in order to accomplish that.
