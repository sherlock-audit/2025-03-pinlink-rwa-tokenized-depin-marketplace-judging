 ### Multiple Identical Listings Allowed Due to block.number in Hash (Marketplace Redundancy and Potential Abuse) in `PinlinkShop::_list`


### Summary

In the `PinlinkShop` , the `listingId` is generated using a hash that includes `block.number` alongside parameters like `fractionalAssets`, `tokenId`, `amount`, `usdPricePerFraction`, `deadline`, and `msg.sender`. While a check prevents duplicate `listingIds`, the use of `block.number` means a seller be it an admin or seller who can list asset bought, can create multiple listings with identical parameters in different blocks, each resulting in a unique `listingId`. This allows redundant listings to exist, as the contract does not enforce uniqueness of listing content beyond the `listingId`.

### Root Cause

The use of `block.number` to generate unique listing Id to allow same `tokenId` to be listed multiple time  with varying listing values

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

1. Marketplace Clutter: Multiple identical listings can flood the marketplace, making it harder for buyers to navigate.
2. User Confusion: Buyers may not easily differentiate between redundant listings, potentially eroding trust.
3. Each listing consumes storage and increases gas costs for users interacting with the contract.

### PoC

1.A seller creates a listing with parameters: fractionalAssets = 0xABC, tokenId = 1, amount = 100, usdPricePerFraction = 1e18, deadline = 1700000000 in block 1000.
2. In block 1001, the same seller submits an identical listing with the same parameters.
3. Both listings are stored with unique listingIds because block.number differs, even though the listings are functionally the same.
The issue occurs in [[PinlinkShop.sol#L489-L503]](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol)

```javascript
function _list(
    address fractionalAssets,
    uint256 tokenId,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 usdPricePerFraction,
    uint256 deadline
) internal returns (bytes32 listingId) {
    listingId = keccak256(
        abi.encode(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, amount, usdPricePerFraction, deadline, block.number)
    );
    require(_listings[listingId].seller == address(0), ListingIdAlreadyExists());
  
}
```

### Mitigation

The use of `block.number` in the `listingId` hash, ensures uniqueness across blocks, there is a possible way to mitigate the risks of redundant listings in order to allow  same seller listing the same `tokenId` to list with different token amount , duration or price:   

1.  Limit Listings per Seller: Set a cap on how many active listings a seller can create for the same fractionalAssets and tokenId. For example, restrict sellers to 5 active listings per asset to curb flooding.
2.  Seller Guidance: Encourage sellers to modify existing listings (e.g., adjust amount) instead of creating new ones for identical terms.
