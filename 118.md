# DOS for all purchases when `purchaseFeePerc` is set to zero

### Summary

The PIN token contract does not allow zero token transfers and will revert if they occur. `PinlinkShop::purchase` transfers fees to the ` feeReceiver` in the same transaction as the purchase. This becomes an issue when the `purchaseFeePerc` is set to zero as the fee transfer will always fail, causing all purchases to always fail.

### Root Cause

In [PinlinkShop::setFeeReceiver](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L168), there is no restriction on the minimum value for `feeReceiver`
