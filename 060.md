# Uncertainty and Non-Direct use of `REWARD_PROXY_ACCOUNT` as the receiver in `enableAsset` can lead to complete DOS

### Summary

In `PinLinkShop` - The admin first enables an asset by calling `enableAsset` : This function sets the `assetSupply` for the specific tokenID and attributes the entire assetSupply to the `stakedBalance` of the arbitrary `receiver` address that is passed in during the function call.

```solidity
  function enableAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, address receiver)
        external
        onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
    {
        RewardsStream storage stream = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId];

        if (stream.isEnabled()) revert AlreadyEnabled();

        uint256 assetSupply = IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).totalSupply(tokenId);
        stream.enableAsset(assetSupply, receiver);
```

// The Flow then invokes `streams::enableAsets` -> which sets the stakedBalances of `receiver` to the total asset supply

```solidity 
 function enableAsset(RewardsStream storage self, uint256 assetSupply, address receiver) internal {
        require(assetSupply > 0, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyIsZero());
        require(assetSupply < MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh());
        // At the beginning, all supply starts earing rewards for the receiver until purchased (admin account)
        self.updateRewards(receiver);
        self.stakedBalances[receiver] += assetSupply;
```

The potential issue is that the `receiver` is an arbitrary address that is passed in, but the codebase will only work properly if the `receiver` address is `REWARD_PROXY_ACCOUNT` - If the `receiver` is not that address, users will never be able to deposit and the system will be completely DOS.

We will go over the potential DOS below.



### Root Cause

Providing an arbitrary `receiver` address in `enableAsset` - which implies any admin account can be passed in, instead of providing the hardcoded `REWARD_PROXY_ACCOUNT` as the receiver. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

None. 

### External Pre-conditions

1. Admin calls `enableAsset` and passes in an admin address that is not the hardcoded `REWARD_PROXY_ACCOUNT` 

### Attack Path

1. The scenario provided in the summary occurs, and the admin calls `enableAsset` with an admin address that is not the hardcoded `REWARD_PROXY_ACCOUNT` as the `receiver`. 
2. The `receiver` gets their `stakedBalance` updated with the total asset supply of that `tokenId`. 
3. A User tries to `deposit` into the system, but will fail because of the following:

When a user tries to deposit, they will call `deposit` and the function will update the `stakedBalances` of the user depositing by calling `stream::transferBalances` BUT this function assumes that `REWARD_PROXY_ACCOUNT` has a stakedBalance, which it may not:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L522-L528


```solidity
    function _deposit(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) internal {
        // it is only possible to deposit in already enabled assets in the ecosystem
        if (!streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].isEnabled()) revert AssetNotEnabled();

        // When assets are withdrawn, the rewards are directed to the feeReceiver.
        // When they are deposited back, they are redirected to the staker who deposits
 ->       streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, msg.sender, amount);
```

When `transferBalances` is called, the function will subtract `amount` from the stakedBalances of `REWARD_PROXY_ACCOUNT` - BUT that account may have a stakedBalance of 0

```solidity
   function transferBalances(RewardsStream storage self, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        self.updateRewards(from);
        self.updateRewards(to);
->        self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount;
        self.stakedBalances[to] += amount;
```

In this case, the function will underflow and revert because the `REWARD_PROXY_ACCOUNT` wasnt the `receiver` when the asset was enabled, so that address does not have a stakedBalance. 

### Impact

This flow occurs for all deposits, the function assumes that `REWARD_PROXY_ACCOUNT` has the stakedBalance of the total supply and subtracts from its balance and redistributes the amount by adding to the stakedBalance of the user depositing. 

This is because the total supply of the tokenId is immutable and never changes, so its just a redistribution of the accounting of staked balances, but if `REWARD_PROXY_ACCOUNT` IS NOT the `receiver` when the asset is enabled, all deposits will fail and revert.

The `REWARD_PROXY_ACCOUNT` is hardcoded to be the `from` in the `deposit` functions , so it is always assumed to have the stakedBalance of the original total supply and its staked balance will always be subtracted within the deposit function flow, that cannot change. So if it is not the `receiver` in the `enableAsset` function, the protocol will never be able to accept deposits.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I dont see the reason for allowing an arbitrary `receiver` in the `enableAsset` function, while maintaining a hardcoded `REWARD_PROXY_ACCOUNT` for all deposits. That asymmetry opens the possibility for complete DOS of that tokenId and goes against the logic of the rest of the protocol. 

Being that once an asset is enabled it can never be disabled, and the immutable nature of the total supply and initialization of the stakedBalances of the `receiver` - it should be imperative to make sure that `REWARD_PROXY_ACCOUNT` is the `receiver` in `enableAsset`
