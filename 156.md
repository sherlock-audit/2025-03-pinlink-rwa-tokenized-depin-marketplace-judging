# Zero Amount Withdrawals Can Trigger Reward Updates

## Vulnerability Details

The `withdrawAsset` function in the `PinlinkShop` contract allows users to withdraw assets from the Pinlink ecosystem. However, there is no validation to ensure that the withdrawal amount is greater than zero. This creates a vulnerability where users can call this function with an amount of zero to trigger reward updates without actually withdrawing any tokens.

The issue is in the `withdrawAsset` function:

[pinlinkShop.sol::withdrawAsset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L352)

```solidity
function withdrawAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, address receiver) external {
    if (_nonListedBalance(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender) < amount) revert NotEnoughUnlistedTokens();

    // this does't transfer the assets, but only the internal accounting of staking balances
    streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(msg.sender, REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, amount); // @audit if amount is 0 user can update his rewards

    emit FractionsWithdrawn(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, receiver);
    IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(address(this), receiver, tokenId, amount, "");
}
```

When `withdrawAsset` is called, it invokes `transferBalances` which in turn calls `updateRewards` for both the sender and receiver:

```solidity
function transferBalances(RewardsStream storage self, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    self.updateRewards(from);
    self.updateRewards(to);
    self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount;
    self.stakedBalances[to] += amount;
}
```

The vulnerability exists because:
1. There's no check that `amount > 0` in the `withdrawAsset` function
2. When `amount = 0`, the `_nonListedBalance` check will pass
3. `transferBalances` will still call `updateRewards(from)` and `updateRewards(to)`
4. The subsequent balance updates (`stakedBalances[from] -= amount` and `stakedBalances[to] += amount`) will have no effect when `amount = 0`
5. The final `safeTransferFrom` will transfer 0 tokens, which is typically allowed in ERC20/ERC1155 implementations

## Impact

This vulnerability allows users to manipulate the reward distribution system by:

1. **Gaming the Reward Mechanism**: Users can call `withdrawAsset` with zero amount at strategic times to update their rewards without actually withdrawing any assets. This could be exploited to maximize rewards based on price fluctuations or other market conditions.

2. **Potential DoS Vector**: If many users exploit this vulnerability, it could lead to increased gas costs and network congestion due to unnecessary reward calculations.

3. **Reward Timing Manipulation**: The reward system likely assumes that rewards are updated at specific intervals or during legitimate transactions. This vulnerability allows users to update their rewards at will, potentially disrupting the intended reward distribution model.

4. **Unfair Advantage**: Users who are aware of this vulnerability can gain an advantage over other users who only have their rewards updated during legitimate transactions.

## Mitigation

To fix this vulnerability, implement a check to ensure that the withdrawal amount is greater than zero:

[pinlinkShop.sol::withdrawAsset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L352)

```Diff
function withdrawAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, address receiver) external {
+   require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");
    if (_nonListedBalance(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender) < amount) revert NotEnoughUnlistedTokens();

    // this does't transfer the assets, but only the internal accounting of staking balances
    streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(msg.sender, REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, amount);

    emit FractionsWithdrawn(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, receiver);
    IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(address(this), receiver, tokenId, amount, "");
}
```

Alternatively, you could use a custom error for consistency with the rest of the codebase:

```solidity
if (amount == 0) revert ExpectedNonZero();
```

This check ensures that users cannot exploit the reward update mechanism without actually withdrawing assets.
