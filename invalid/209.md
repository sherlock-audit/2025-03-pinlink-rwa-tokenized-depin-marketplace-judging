# Incorrect Maximum Asset Supply Validation

### Summary

An incorrect comparison operator in [enableAsset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/34cd70b66f1dbe191bd6f946e42f58eef4a00166/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L64-L71) will cause a denial of service as assets with exactly the maximum asset supply will be wrongfully rejected.

### Root Cause

In [StreamHandler.sol:66](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/34cd70b66f1dbe191bd6f946e42f58eef4a00166/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L66), the condition checking if assetSupply is below the maximum allowed value uses a strict less than operator (<) instead of less than or equal to (<=). This prevents asset supplies equal to MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY from being enabled, even though they should be valid according to the protocol's design intention.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The protocol has defined MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY as 1e4 (10,000) which is a reasonable maximum value
An asset provider needs to call a function that invokes enableAsset() with an assetSupply parameter exactly equal to 10,000

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

Admin attempts to enable an asset with exactly 10,000 tokens (which should be valid)
The enableAsset function checks if assetSupply < MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY
Since 10,000 == 10,000 (not less than), the condition fails
The transaction reverts with PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh() error
The asset provider is unable to enable their asset despite it being within the allowed limits

### Impact

Admin cannot enable assets with exactly 10,000 total supply, leading to unnecessary transaction failures and no support for legitimate tokens that should be supported

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the comparison operator from < to <= in the enableAsset function:
