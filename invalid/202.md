# streams::Arithmetic Precision Errors


In the function `depositRewards`, the calculation `uint256 delta = (amount * PRECISION) / self.assetSupply;` can lead to precision errors as the amount is multiplied by a large number (`PRECISION`) and then divided by the `self.assetSupply`. 

Similarly, in the function `_pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate`, the calculation 
`(self.stakedBalances[account] * (globalPerStaked - self.updatedRewardsPerStaked[account])) / PRECISION;` can also lead to precision errors as it involves multiply and divide operations involving large numbers and small decimals. 

These errors can lead to discrepancies in the calculated reward amounts, impacting the accurate distribution of tokens.

### Example
An example of affected code snippets are:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L100

```solidity
uint256 delta = (amount * PRECISION) / self.assetSupply;
```
and
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L149

```solidity
(self.stakedBalances[account] * (globalPerStaked - self.updatedRewardsPerStaked[account])) / PRECISION;
```

### Recommendation

To mitigate potential precision errors, consider using a library for safe math operations that is designed to handle such issues in Solidity. The OpenZeppelin library provides SafeMath which can help.

Whenever possible, try to avoid performing divisions until the end of the calculation to limit the cumulative impact of precision loss. Additionally, using higher precision for intermediate arithmetic operations can also help to minimize the errors.
