# Users will steal rewards from the protocol by exploiting the withdraw and deposit mechanism

### Summary

The missing validation in the withdraw and deposit functions will cause a loss of rewards for the protocol as malicious users will repeatedly withdraw and deposit the same assets to accumulate rewards illegitimately.



### Root Cause

In `pinlinkShop.sol` the handling of rewards during [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L352C4-L360C6) and [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L208C4-L218C6) operations doesn't properly protect against timing attacks. When a user withdraws assets, their rewards are transferred to the REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, but when depositing them back, the user can effectively reset their position while keeping the rewards they've earned.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to have staked fractional assets in the PinlinkShop contract
2. Rewards need to be actively streaming to the asset class the user holds
3. The PinlinkShop contract needs to have a non-zero balance of REWARDS_TOKEN (USDC)


### External Pre-conditions

1. None required - this attack can be executed with normal protocol operation


### Attack Path

1. **User calls `claimRewards()` to collect any pending rewards up to the current point**
2. **User calls `withdrawAsset()` to withdraw their fractional assets from the PinlinkShop**
   - This transfers the rewards calculation to REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT
3. **User immediately calls `depositAsset()` to deposit the same assets back into the PinlinkShop**
   - This resets the user's position in the rewards stream
4. **User repeats steps 1-3 multiple times to accelerate rewards accumulation**
5. **User executes a final `claimRewards()` to collect all accumulated rewards**


### Impact

The protocol suffers an unintended loss of REWARDS_TOKEN (USDC) each time this cycle is performed. The attacker gains rewards at an accelerated rate compared to legitimate stakers, essentially draining rewards that should be distributed over a longer time period or to other users. This undermines the entire rewards distribution mechanism and the economic incentives of the platform.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a cooldown period between withdrawals and deposits or track the cumulative rewards per token more carefully to ensure users cannot game the rewards system. Another approach is to create a withdrawal request system where withdrawals are processed after a delay, ensuring users cannot quickly cycle assets to manipulate rewards.
