# Seller can bypass fee payment by withdrawing and trading fractional tokens instead

### Summary

The `purchase()` function in the `pinlinkShop.sol` file deducts fee before the price is transfered to the seller. However, there is no fee associated with the `depositAsset` and `withdrawAsset` functions.

So instead of registering listings to sell stakedTokens, seller is encouraged to withdrawAsset to get the fractional token out and then trade the token outside the protocol to bypass fee payment. 

### Root Cause

`withdrawAsset` and `depositAsset` functions does not collect fees unlike `purchase` function which collects fees.

deposit function : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L364

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Seller has some fractional tokens to sell
2. Buyer has enough PIN token to pay for the fractional token.

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Seller and Buyer decide to bypass the fee payment (This agreement can happen offline or in another smart contract outside the protocol)
2. Seller withdraws fractional token using the `withdrawAsset` function
3. The withdrawn token is traded outside of the protocol
4. Buyer deposits the fractional token back into the protocol using the `depositAsset` function
5. The fractional token is successfully transfered from Seller to Buyer without any fee paid to the protocol.

### Impact

Although Buyers and Sellers reaching an agreement outside of the protocol might seem unlikely, it is very possible that a malicious party can deploy a smart contract which allows buyers and sellers to reach agreement without fee or with less fee than the original protocol. It will greatly impact the profitability of this protocol because users will be encouraged to use the malicious smart contract instead of the original `list` and `purchase` functions.

Until agreement is reached, the seller can still collect rewards because the fractional token is still in the protocol until seller decide to withdraw the asset.

Since fee collection is the only way this protocol makes revenue, a way for users to bypass fee payment damages the profitability of this protocol greatly.

### Mitigation

Consider collecting fees on `withdrawAsset` or `depositAsset` functions as well
