# simulateMarketActions.sol-- Hardcoded contract address and centralized listing strategy introduce market manipulation and configuration risks

### Summary

The PinlinkShopSetupScript used in `simulateMarketActions.sol` hardcodes both the PinlinkShop contract (Line 16) and FractionalAssets contract (Line 17), and performs all listing and modification actions via a privileged developer key `(DEV_PKEY)`. Listings, delistings, price manipulations, and reward injections are all controlled via a centralized script with no safeguards or decentralized listing logic, enabling potential market manipulation, operator error, and fragile environment portability.

### Root Cause

 • Line 16–17: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/pinlinkshop/simulateMarketActions.sol#L16-L17

`PinlinkShop pshop = PinlinkShop(0x46564999721055c7E5C32d857BCf766Aa4A4f626);`
`FractionalAssets fractionalAssets = FractionalAssets(0x82C4b8FF3C9016C775eD160D8D40E2614c44b9BA);`



→ Hardcoded contract dependencies prevent safe reuse across environments.
 • Lines 25–35: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/pinlinkshop/simulateMarketActions.sol#L25-L35

`function _list() internal {
    vm.startBroadcast(DEV_PKEY);
    pshop.list(address(fractionalAssets), 3662385719, 20, 1500e18, block.timestamp + 365 days);
    ...
    pshop.list(address(fractionalAssets), 2983557137, 10, 1000e18, block.timestamp + 1 minutes);
    vm.stopBroadcast();
}`

→ All initial listings are controlled exclusively by DEV_PKEY with arbitrary prices and durations.
 • Lines 38–75 (_marketActions): https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/pinlinkshop/simulateMarketActions.sol#L38-L75

`vm.broadcast(DEV_PKEY);
pshop.modifyListing(...);
pshop.delist(...);`

→ All listing modifications and removals are centrally executed by the dev account without verification logic.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Developer executes this script in a production deployment pipeline.
2. `DEV_PKEY` is assumed to be secure and operational at all times.
3. Listing/market actions are not subject to protocol governance or on-chain rules.



### External Pre-conditions

1. `DEV_PKEY` is compromised or misused.
2. Project relies on this script without protective validation layers.
3. No contract-level restriction enforces listing/de-listing behavior limits.


### Attack Path

1. Attacker obtains `DEV_PKEY` or internal actor misuses it.
2. They re-run `_list()` or `_marketActions()` with malicious prices, short deadlines, or spam listings.
3. Alternatively, they can silently delist valid user listings or alter existing listings’ pricing to exploit frontend UX.
4. Market appears manipulated without any smart contract-level restriction or detection.



### Impact

• Market integrity is compromised by unilateral listing control.
• Potential rugpull through malicious delisting or price resets.
• Degraded protocol trust due to dev-level listing power.
• Fragility in deployment due to hardcoded contract addresses.

`pshop.list(address(fractionalAssets), 2983557137, 10, 1000e18, block.timestamp + 1 minutes);`// frontend filtering bait

`pshop.modifyListing(listingId1, 15e18, 0);`
`pshop.delist(listingId2, 2);`
`pshop.list(address(fractionalAssets), 3662385719, 2, 111e18, block.timestamp + 65 days);`



### Mitigation

 • Replace hardcoded contract instantiation with environment-injected addresses:

`PinlinkShop pshop = PinlinkShop(vm.envAddress("PINSHOP_ADDRESS"));`
`FractionalAssets fractionalAssets = FractionalAssets(vm.envAddress("FRACTIONAL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"));`

 • `Restrict _list()` and `_marketActions()` usage in production pipelines; only allow admin-governed execution through on-chain proposals or multisig-controlled batch runners.

• Introduce modifier checks in the `PinlinkShop` contract to limit listing manipulation access to governance-controlled contracts, not raw EOAs.
 • Validate listing.duration, priceRange, and ensure frontend-filtered listings are protocol-governed, not centralized dev shortcuts.
