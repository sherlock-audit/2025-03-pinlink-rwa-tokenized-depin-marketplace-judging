# Attackers will block legitimate asset listings through listing ID collisions

### Summary

The deterministic listing ID generation without unique identifiers will cause a denial of service attack for legitimate sellers as malicious users will front-run transactions with identical parameters to create listing ID collisions.


### Root Cause

- In `PinlinkShop.sol:_list()` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L489), the listing ID is generated using `keccak256(abi.encode(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, amount, usdPricePerFraction, deadline, block.number))` without any unique component like a nonce, allowing identical listings within the same block to produce the same ID.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A seller needs to call `list()` or `depositAndList()` to create a listing with specific parameters.
2. The call must include fractionalAssets address, tokenId, amount, price, and deadline values.
3. The listing must be created within the same block as an attacker's matching listing.


### External Pre-conditions

1. Mempool must be public to allow attackers to observe pending transactions.
2. Network conditions must allow for successful front-running (attackers can get their transactions mined before legitimate ones).


### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors the mempool for pending listing transactions.
2. Attacker identifies a target seller's listing transaction with specific parameters.
3. Attacker creates their own listing transaction with identical parameters (same fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, usdPricePerFraction, and deadline).
4. Attacker submits their transaction with higher gas price to ensure it gets mined before the legitimate transaction.
5. Attacker's listing succeeds and creates a listing with the deterministic ID.
6. The legitimate seller's transaction reverts with `ListingIdAlreadyExists()` error.


### Impact

The legitimate sellers suffer from an inability to create listings with their desired parameters, causing frustration and potential loss of market opportunities. The attacker must spend gas to perform this attack and doesn't directly gain financial assets (griefing attack), but may gain indirect market advantages by preventing competitors from listing at specific times or prices.


### PoC

```solidity
// Example pseudocode to demonstrate the collision
function testListingCollision() external {
    // Assume all parameters are identical
    address fractionalAssets = 0xAbCd...; // Example address
    uint256 tokenId = 1;
    uint256 amount = 100;
    uint256 usdPricePerFraction = 1e18; // e.g., $1.00 with 18 decimals
    uint256 deadline = block.timestamp + 1 days;

    // First listing: succeeds
    bytes32 listingId1 = _list(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, usdPricePerFraction, deadline);
    
    // Second listing in the same block with identical parameters:
    // This call will compute the same listingId due to identical parameters including block.number,
    // and will revert with ListingIdAlreadyExists.
    bytes32 listingId2 = _list(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, usdPricePerFraction, deadline);
}
```
