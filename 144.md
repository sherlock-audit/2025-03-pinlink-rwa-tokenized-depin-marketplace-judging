# Zero-Weight Reward Loss Vulnerability in PinlinkShop

### Summary

The depositRewards function does not properly handle cases where the total staked supply (assetSupply) is zero.

If no one is staking an asset but rewards are deposited, these incentives get lost instead of being refunded to the protocol.
This leads to financial loss where staking incentives are not returned to REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT.

### Root Cause

The core issue is in depositRewards():
The contract assumes that rewards will always have stakers.
If no one is staking (assetSupply == 0), the function still processes rewards.
This leads to lost incentives instead of being refunded.


### Internal Pre-conditions

(1) No active stakers (assetSupply == 0)
(2) Rewards deposit is triggered
(3) Division by zero in reward calculation
(4) Missing refund logic causes lost incentives

### External Pre-conditions

(1) No users have staked (assetSupply == 0).
(2) Admin/operator deposits rewards.
(3) The contract holds USDC for rewards.
(4) Missing refund logic in the contract.
(5) No way to reclaim lost incentives.

### Attack Path

Attack Setup(Ensure the Asset Supply is Zero (assetSupply == 0))

The admin enables a new asset (tokenId) on PinlinkShop, but no users stake.
If an asset was previously staked, all users withdraw their fractions.
This sets assetSupply = 0, making it impossible to distribute rewards.

Operator Deposits Rewards
Who? The contract operator (OPERATOR_ROLE).
How? The operator calls depositRewards() for an asset with no stakers.

Attack Execution

The operator deposits rewards for an empty asset.
The contract accepts the deposit without checking if stakers exist.
Funds remain locked in the contract, unclaimable forever.



### Impact

Severity: HIGH
This vulnerability results in the permanent loss of staking incentives, which directly affects the core tokenomics and staking model of the protocol. Since rewards cannot be reclaimed or redirected, this leads to inefficiencies in reward distribution, potential trust issues among users, and economic losses for participants.

        uint256 balanceAfter = USDC.balanceOf(rewardsProxy);
        assertEq(balanceAfter, balanceBefore + amount, "Rewards were not refunded");
    }

    /// @notice Ensure deposit reverts if `assetSupply == 0` and refund logic is missing
    function test_depositRewards_revertsIfNoRefundLogic() public {
        uint256 amount = 100e6; // 100 USDC

        // Ensure assetSupply is zero
        (uint256 assetSupply, , , ) = pshop.getAssetInfo(address(fractions), asset1);
        assertEq(assetSupply, 0, "assetSupply should be zero");

        // Expect revert due to division by zero
        vm.prank(operator);
        vm.expectRevert(); // Expect a generic revert (to detect missing refund logic)
        pshop.depositRewards(address(fractions), asset1, amount, 1 days);
    }
}
```
What This Means?
The RewardsStream logic expects assetSupply > 0 to distribute rewards.
If assetSupply == 0, deposited rewards should be refunded to prevent loss.
Currently, there is no logic to refund unused rewards when assetSupply == 0, leading to "lost" staking incentives.

### Mitigation

add refund logic inside depositRewards
