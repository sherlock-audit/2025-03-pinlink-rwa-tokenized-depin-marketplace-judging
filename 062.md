# Stale Oracle Price in purchase function will cause purchase failures

## Summary
If the centralized oracle returns a stale price due to delayed updates or a failure in the update bot, the conversion from USD to PIN tokens may yield zero. The purchase function in `PinlinkShop.sol` then reverts, preventing legitimate buyers from purchasing fractionalized assets and disrupting the marketplace.

## Root Cause
In the purchase function, the conversion from USD to PIN tokens is performed using the oracle’s price:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L313C8-L316C61

```solidity
        uint256 totalUsdPayment = listing.usdPricePerFraction * fractionsAmount;
        uint256 totalPinPayment = IPinlinkOracle(oracle).convertFromUsd(address(PIN), totalUsdPayment);


        if (totalPinPayment == 0) revert StaleOraclePrice();
```
**Issue:**
If the oracle’s price is stale (i.e., not updated within the staleness threshold), the conversion returns 0. The function then reverts with `StaleOraclePrice()`, blocking the purchase.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. The oracle price is used to convert the USD amount to PIN tokens.
2. The function strictly reverts if the conversion result is 0.

## External Pre-conditions
1. The oracle update bot may delay its update due to its periodic check or failed sanity checks.
2. Rapid market changes or external manipulation may cause the oracle to become stale.

## Attack Path
1. Preparation: The oracle’s price becomes stale (e.g., due to a delayed update by the bot).
2. Execution: A buyer attempts to purchase asset fractions.
3. Result: The call to `IPinlinkOracle(oracle).convertFromUsd` returns 0 because the price is considered stale.

## Impact
- The purchase transaction reverts with `StaleOraclePrice()`, preventing the sale.
   - Legitimate buyers are unable to complete purchases, leading to a denial-of-service on the marketplace. This disrupts market operations, potentially preventing asset trading and harming both buyers and sellers.

## PoC
**PoC Summary:**
This PoC simulates a purchase attempt when the oracle returns a stale price (i.e., 0), causing the transaction to revert.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.27;

import "./pinlinkShop.sol";

contract PoCStaleOracle {
    PinlinkShop public shop;

    constructor(address _shop) {
        shop = PinlinkShop(_shop);
    }

    function attack(bytes32 listingId, uint256 fractionsAmount, uint256 maxTotalPinAmount) external {
        // This call will revert if the oracle returns 0 due to stale price data.
        shop.purchase(listingId, fractionsAmount, maxTotalPinAmount);
    }
}
```
**PoC Explanation:**
- The Bug:
The purchase function relies on the oracle’s conversion result. If the oracle’s data is stale, it returns 0, causing the function to revert.

- How It Works:
For example, assume the listing price converts to a non-zero value under normal conditions. However, if the oracle’s last update exceeds the staleness threshold, the conversion returns `0`. The purchase function then reverts with `StaleOraclePrice()`, blocking the purchase.

- Attack Scenario:
An attacker (or a scenario with a misbehaving oracle bot) leaves the oracle price stale. When a buyer tries to purchase asset fractions, the conversion returns `0`, causing the transaction to revert. This denial-of-service prevents legitimate trades and disrupts market operations.

## Mitigation
- Enhance Oracle Updates:
Increase the update frequency and enforce stricter thresholds to ensure the price is fresh.
- Fallback Mechanism:
Integrate a secondary price source (e.g., TWAP or Chainlink) as a fallback when the primary oracle returns `0`.
- Graceful Handling:
Consider allowing the transaction to proceed using a fallback price or a temporary delay rather than outright reverting.
