# Malicious minters will reuse burned token IDs, impacting users and external systems

### Summary

The lack of historical token ID tracking will cause data integrity issues for users and external systems as malicious minters will reuse completely burned token IDs to create conflicting asset identifiers.


### Root Cause

- In FractionalAssets.sol:30-35 there is only a check for current [non-zero supply](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/fractional/FractionalAssets.sol#L28) (`totalSupply(tokenId) != 0`) before minting, without tracking whether token IDs have been used historically:
```solidity
function mint(uint256 tokenId, address to, uint256 assetSupply) external onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
    if (assetSupply == 0) revert FractionalAssets_InvalidTotalSupply();
    if (totalSupply(tokenId) != 0) revert FractionalAssets_TokenIdAlreadyExists();

    _mint(to, tokenId, assetSupply, "");
}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A token with a specific ID needs to be completely burned, bringing its total supply to zero
2. The actor needs to have MINTER_ROLE to call the mint function
3. The actor needs to specify a previously used token ID when calling mint


### External Pre-conditions

1. External systems need to rely on token IDs as permanent unique identifiers
2. PinlinkShop needs to have previously tracked rewards for the specific token ID


### Attack Path

1. A minter creates Asset A with token ID 1 and distributes it to users
2. All tokens with ID 1 are eventually burned (reducing supply to zero)
3. The minter creates an entirely different Asset B but reuses token ID 1
4. PinlinkShop and external systems associate Asset B with Asset A's historical data
5. Users interact with Asset B believing it has the properties and history of Asset A


### Impact

The users suffer from data integrity issues and potential financial losses. Specifically in PinlinkShop, rewards data could be incorrectly applied between different assets using the same token ID, potentially causing:
- Incorrect reward distributions
- Confusion in asset ownership history
- Metadata/URI conflicts where a completely different asset inherits the identifier of a previous one


### PoC

1. **Initial Minting:**  
   - Call `mint(tokenId, user, assetSupply)`.
   - `_tokenIdsUsed[tokenId]` is set to `true`.
   - Asset is minted successfully.

2. **Burning the Token:**  
   - The token is burned, so `totalSupply(tokenId)` becomes `0`.
   - However, `_tokenIdsUsed[tokenId]` remains `true`.

3. **Attempting to Reuse the Same Token ID:**  
   - Call `mint(tokenId, anotherUser, newAssetSupply)`.
   - The check `_tokenIdsUsed[tokenId]` fails and the transaction reverts, preventing token ID reuse.

This PoC demonstrates that the token ID, once used, cannot be reused even after burning, preserving the uniqueness expected by external systems.
