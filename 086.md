# Reward Distribution Logic Flaw in Purchase Function

### Summary

A critical vulnerability exists in the reward distribution mechanism during asset purchases. Attackers can exploit this flaw to steal unclaimed rewards from sellers and illegitimately accumulate rewards as buyers, leading to unfair reward allocation and potential drainage of the rewards pool.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L288-L325
Code Location:
```solidity
// PinlinkShop.sol - purchase() function  
streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(seller, buyer, amount);  
```
The transferBalances function moves staking balances between accounts ​without first settling pending rewards.
The reward calculation formula uses lastUpdateTime and stakedBalances to compute accrued rewards. Transferring balances without updating rewards allows:
​Sellers to lose rewards accumulated before the transfer.
​Buyers to inherit the seller's reward accrual period, artificially inflating their future rewards.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

​Phase 1 - Reward Accumulation:

Seller deposits 1,000 tokens via depositAsset() → stakedBalances[seller] = 1,000.
Rewards are distributed over 15 days:
sellerRewards = 1,000 * (TotalRewards * 15 days) / (TotalStaked * 30 days)  
​Phase 2 - Malicious Purchase:

Buyer purchases all 1,000 tokens via purchase() without reward settlement:
Effect:
Seller's stakedBalances drops to 0 → Pending rewards are irrecoverably lost.
Buyer's stakedBalances increases to 1,000 → Inherits the full 15-day reward period.
​Phase 3 - Reward Theft:

After another 15 days:
buyerRewards = 1,000 * (TotalRewards * 30 days) / (TotalStaked * 30 days)  
​Result: Buyer claims ​100% of rewards instead of the correct 50%.

### Impact

Sellers permanently lose rewards accumulated before asset transfers.
