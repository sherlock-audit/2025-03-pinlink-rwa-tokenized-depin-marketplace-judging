# Ownable uses single-step ownership transfer.

### Summary
Lack of two-step process for contract ownership changes.

### Root Cause
When called, the transferOwnership function immediately sets the contract owner to the provided address. The use of a single step to make such a critical change is error-prone; if the function is called with erroneous input, the results could be irrevocable or difficult to recover from.

The CentralizedOracle contract inherits ownership logic from the [OpenZeppelin Ownable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L11) contract, which allows the current owner to transfer the contract ownership to another address using the transferOwnership function:

```solidity
/// @File: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol#L84-L89

    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual onlyOwner {
        if (newOwner == address(0)) {
            revert OwnableInvalidOwner(address(0));
        }
        _transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }    
```

If the functions are called with erroneous input, the PinLinkAi team could lose the ability to call `CentralizedOracle::updateTokenPrice()` function.

```solidity
/// @File: marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol

    // @audit-issue - price will not be updated if erroneous input.
    function updateTokenPrice(uint256 usdPerToken) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 _currentPrice = _tokenPriceInUsd;

        // sanity checks to avoid too large deviations caused by bot/human errors
        if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
        if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();

        _tokenPriceInUsd = usdPerToken;
        lastPriceUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        // todo potential improvement. Everytime we update, we crosscheck the price with the Uniswap spot price
        //  - centralized, but controlled by a decentralized oracle, so that we can't manipulate it
        //  - cheaper to run than a TWAP oracle
        //  - less manipulable (except by us)

        emit PriceUpdated(usdPerToken);
    }
```
### Impact

**Severity : Medium**

**Likelihood:** Low, because it requires an error on the admin side.

**Impact:** High, due to the blocking of crucial protocol functionality.

### Mitigation

Use two-step ownership transfer pattern, meaning ownership transfer gets to a "pending" state and the new owner should claim his new rights, otherwise the old owner still has control of the contract. Consider using [OpenZeppelin's Ownable2Step](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol) contract.
