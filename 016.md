**Lines Affected**
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L236-L244

**Description** In the contract `pinlinkShop.sol` the function `PinlinkShop::list()` is marked as external, which allows everyone to call this function, which calls the `PinlinkShop::_link()` which is responsible to generate `listingId` and store the listing in the mapping called `_listings`. As per the Contract `PinlinkShop::_list` should only be called by the `deposit()`function which will assure the asset is deposited.

**Impact** It will allow anyone to create a fake listing in the marketplace and can cause the loss of the asset.

**Tool Used**
Manual Review

**Recommendation Mitigation** 
1. Add the modifier to check the caller of the function is the owner of the asset.
2. Remove the `PinlinkShp::list()` function and only allow the `deposit()` function to call `_list()` function.
