# ### [M-2] Checks for big price fluctuation that intend to prevent human / bot errors might also undesirably stop the protocol in volatile market conditions

### Summary

In the `CentralizedOracle` contract, the `updateTokenPrice` function is used to update the price of the token. 

```javascript
   /// @notice Update the price of TOKEN in USD terms
    /// @dev The price should be expressed with 18 decimals.
    /// @dev Example. To set the TOKEN price to 0.88 USD, the input should be 880000000000000000
    function updateTokenPrice(uint256 usdPerToken) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 _currentPrice = _tokenPriceInUsd;

        // sanity checks to avoid too large deviations caused by bot/human errors
@>        if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
@>        if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();

        _tokenPriceInUsd = usdPerToken;
        lastPriceUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        // todo potential improvement. Everytime we update, we crosscheck the price with the Uniswap spot price
        //  - centralized, but controlled by a decentralized oracle, so that we can't manipulate it
        //  - cheaper to run than a TWAP oracle
        //  - less manipulable (except by us)

        emit PriceUpdated(usdPerToken);
    }
```
Inside it, two checks are performed, seeing whether the price of the token is 5 times higher or lower than it was for the last check, reverting in both cases.
```javascript
     if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
     if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();
```
 Thus it intends to prevent strong price movements caused by either human or bot/oracle errors. However, although unlikely, this doesn't account for a scenario in which such price fluctuations could happen by normal market dynamics.
In a case in which the price is correct, and it has changed abruptly in the lapse of minutes that the price update is meant to occur, the price would be unable to get updated and the protocol would stop working as intended.

### Root Cause

These checks could case a price update to revert in volatile market conditions, and a different solution could be picked for security.

```javascript
     if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
     if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Contract is deployed with those checks

### External Pre-conditions

Price updates abruptly either as a >1*5 or  <1/5 of its current value.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits and lists an asset to sell it
2. Price increases by >500% between price updates
3. The next price update reverts
4. A second user comes to buy the asset, and given that the price can't be updated, the price in the pinlinkShop is different than it should, allowing him for example to pay less than the actual price.

### Impact

Until the price gets close enough to the last price (< 1/5 || < 1*5), its value won't be updated for the protocol, thus affecting all functions which need the oracle, providing them with incorrect information.
-Transactions made through the `pinlinkShop::purchase` function would have incorrect pricing (and get sold at prices significatively lower than their sellers would desire)
-`pinlinkShop::getQuoteInTokens` would also return an incorrect value of PIN tokens to pay for the USD value of listed assets.
Within a week the price would also become stale, as estipulated by the dev.

### PoC

1. User deposits and lists an asset to sell it
2. Price increases by >500% between price updates (or reduces by >80%)
3. A second user comes to buy the asset, and given that the price can no longer be updated, the price remains much lower, paying less than the actual price.

### Mitigation

One solution could be opting for a more reliable oracle, and removing these checks
A second solution would be minimizing the time between updates, and/or configuring the bot to perform updates more often than the base interval choosen, depending on trading volume for the PIN token.
