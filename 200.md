# User can set extremely short deadlines leading to failed transactions

### Summary

The lack of minimum deadline validation in `PinlinkShop.sol` will cause transaction failures for buyers as sellers can set deadlines just seconds ahead, making it impossible to execute purchases in high network activity.


### Root Cause

In `PinlinkShop.sol:_list()` the deadline validation only checks if it's greater than current timestamp:
```solidity
require(deadline > block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());
```
This allows deadlines to be set just seconds into the future.


### Internal Pre-conditions


1. Seller needs to call `list()` with a deadline just seconds ahead of `block.timestamp`
2. Number of concurrent buyers in the market to be at least 1
3. The listing must have a reasonable price to attract buyers


### External Pre-conditions

1. Network must have normal or high congestion (>10 second block times)
2. Gas price fluctuations causing transaction delays


### Attack Path

1. Malicious seller creates a listing with attractive price and deadline = `block.timestamp + 5 seconds`
2. Legitimate buyers attempt to purchase but transactions fail with `ListingDeadlineExpired()`
3. Seller repeats this pattern to:
    - Discourage buyers
    - Create false impression of market activity
    - Manipulate price discovery


### Impact

The protocol suffers from market manipulation and reduced usability. Buyers waste gas on failed transactions. The attacker can control market price discovery through artificial scarcity.


### PoC


## PoC
```solidity
function testShortDeadlineGriefing() public {
    // Setup
    uint256 listAmount = 100;
    uint256 pricePerToken = 10e18; // 10 USD per token
    
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    // Create listing with extremely short deadline
    bytes32 listingId = pshop.list(
        address(fractions),
        tokenId,
        listAmount,
        pricePerToken,
        block.timestamp + 5 // 5 second deadline
    );
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Bob attempts to buy
    vm.startPrank(bob);
    uint256 buyAmount = 50;
    uint256 pinAmount = pshop.getQuoteInTokens(listingId, buyAmount);
    PIN.approve(address(pshop), pinAmount);
    
    // Simulate network congestion
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 6);
    
    // Purchase fails due to expired deadline
    vm.expectRevert(PinlinkShop.ListingDeadlineExpired.selector);
    pshop.purchase(listingId, buyAmount, pinAmount);
    vm.stopPrank();
}
```


## Recommendation
Implement a minimum deadline duration of 15 minutes to:
1. Allow sufficient time for transactions to execute
2. Account for network congestion
3. Prevent market manipulation through short deadlines
4. Improve user experience by reducing failed transactions


### Mitigation

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L513

Add minimum deadline duration check in `_list()`:
```solidity
function _list(
    address fractionalAssets,
    uint256 tokenId,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 usdPricePerFraction,
    uint256 deadline
) internal returns (bytes32 listingId) {
    require(deadline >= block.timestamp + 15 minutes, "Deadline too short");
    require(deadline > block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());
    // ... rest of function
}
```
