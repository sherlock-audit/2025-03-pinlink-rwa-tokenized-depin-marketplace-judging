# MEV bots can manipulate transaction ordering around deadlines due to inconsistent deadline checks

### Summary

The inconsistent use of strict inequality operators (> and <) in deadline checks will cause an unfair trading advantage for MEV bots as they can manipulate transaction ordering to exploit the time gap at deadline boundaries.

### Root Cause

# Current Implementation Issues

## Current Code
```solidity
// In modifyListing (Line 278):
require(newDeadline > block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());

// In purchase (Line 300):
require(block.timestamp < listing.deadline, ListingDeadlineExpired());
```

## Potential Risks

### MEV Exploitation:
- MEV bots can monitor the mempool for transactions near the deadline
- They can manipulate the order of transactions in the following scenarios:
  - Front-running purchases just before deadline
  - Back-running deadline modifications
- This creates unfair arbitrage opportunities around the deadline boundary

### Inconsistent Behavior:
- The strict inequality (> and <) creates a "no-man's land" exactly at the deadline
- Users might be confused why their transactions fail exactly at the deadline
- Different comparison operators in different functions make the code less maintainable

## Proposed Solution
```solidity
// In modifyListing (Line 278):
require(newDeadline >= block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());

// In purchase (Line 300):
require(block.timestamp <= listing.deadline, ListingDeadlineExpired());
```

## Benefits of the Fix

### Security Improvements:
- Reduces MEV opportunities by eliminating the time gap
- Makes the deadline boundary inclusive and clear
- Prevents potential price manipulation around deadline boundaries

### Better User Experience:
- Makes deadline behavior more intuitive
- Provides consistent behavior across all deadline-related operations
- Aligns with user expectations of what a "deadline" means

### Code Quality:
- Creates consistency between related functions
- Makes the code more maintainable
- Reduces potential for bugs in future modifications

This modification makes the contract more resistant to MEV attacks while providing a better and more consistent user experience.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Listing owner needs to create or modify a listing to set newDeadline to be close to current block.timestamp
2. User needs to submit a purchase transaction to set block.timestamp to be near listing.deadline
3. MEV bot needs to manipulate transaction order to set transaction execution time from (deadline - ε) to (deadline + ε) within the same block

### External Pre-conditions

1. Block builders need to accept MEV-related transaction reordering requests
2. Network latency needs to be sufficient to allow transaction reordering in the mempool
3. Gas prices need to be profitable enough to make MEV extraction worthwhile

### Attack Path

1. Listing owner calls modifyListing() to set a deadline close to current block.timestamp
2. User submits a purchase transaction when block.timestamp approaches listing.deadline
3. MEV bot monitors the mempool for such purchase transactions
4. MEV bot detects the deadline-sensitive transaction and calculates potential profit
5. MEV bot front-runs the user's purchase transaction by submitting a higher gas price transaction
6. MEV bot back-runs with another transaction to complete the arbitrage

### Impact

If a listing's price is 1 ETH and market price fluctuates by 5% around the deadline, users could suffer a loss up to 0.05 ETH per transaction. The MEV bot gains this 0.05 ETH minus gas fees (approximately 0.01 ETH), resulting in a net profit of 0.04 ETH per successful exploitation.
