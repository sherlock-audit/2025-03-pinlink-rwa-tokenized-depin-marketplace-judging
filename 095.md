# Buyers Leaving Behind Small Fractions Leading to Illiquidity and Financial Loss to the Seller.

### Summary

In [purchase()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L288), buyers can specify the exact amount of tokens they want to purchase without any limit for minimum leftover, which can result in leftover fractions that are difficult or impossible to sell. This leaves sellers with unsellable fractions, forcing them to delist or withdraw the remaining tokens at a loss. This issue reduces liquidity in the marketplace, disadvantages sellers, and can lead to financial losses.

### Root Cause

The function [purchase()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L288) allows buyers to specify any fractionsAmount they want to buy, without enforcing a minimum left over amount. As a result, buyers can purchase large portions of a listing or a malicious buyer waits for significant portion of a listing to be sold, then purchases in a way that leaves 1 token behind. In any case, this leaves behind small fractions that are unattractive to other buyers.

```solidity
listing.amount = listedAmount - fractionsAmount;
```
Also, a malicious last buyer can easily create this condition.

For example, Alice lists 50 token. After multiple purchases, 5 token is left. A malicious buyer notices and decides to buy 4 tokens, intentionally leaving behind 1 token. Other buyers will not purchase 1 token because it is unattractive and insignificant to do so. 

This leads to a seller disadvantages and eventually causes financial loss when the seller reduces the usdPrice for the asset to attract buyers. A seller may also decided to delist and withdraw at a loss, losing out on potential revenue especially in the situation where Alice listed all her tokens. 
**There is no good way out for sellers in this position.**

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The purchase function does not enforce a minimum leftover amount.

2. Sellers cannot increase the amount of tokens in an existing listing, forcing them to create new listings for leftover fractions.

3. The system does not incentivize buyers to purchase entire listings or larger fractions.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Buyers may avoid purchasing small fractions due to perceived inefficiency or lack of value

### Attack Path

1. A seller lists a large amount of tokens or all his/her tokens (e.g., 50 tokens). 

2. A buyer purchases a significant portion of the listing (e.g., 49 tokens), leaving behind a small fraction (e.g., 1 token). **It is also possible that multiple buyers can purchase a portion, and a malicious Last buyer purchases a small portion leaving behind 1 token.**

3. The leftover fraction is unattractive to other buyers, making it difficult or impossible to sell.

4. The seller is forced to delist or withdraw the remaining fraction at a loss, incurring additional gas costs and losing potential revenue.

5. Sellers could as well be forced to reduce the usdPriceperfraction to be able to attract buyers leading to direct financial loss.

### Impact

1. Small leftover fractions reduce liquidity in the marketplace, making it impossible for sellers to sell their token.

2. Sellers lose potential revenue from unsellable fractions. 

3. The marketplace becomes cluttered with unsellable small fractions, reducing overall liquidity.

4. Sellers are forced to either delist or withdraw unsellable fractions, incurring additional costs like gas fees or cost in purchasing more tokens to be able to list again an amount that is attractive to buyers. This would happen especially in cases where seller lists all his/her token and most are bought with 1 token left.

5. In an attempt to sell the leftover fraction after it has overstayed, sellers could be forced to reduce the usdPriceperfraction to be able to attract buyers leading to direct financial loss.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

I would recommend a minimum leftover amount should be implemented to prevent buyers from exploiting this vulnerability.
