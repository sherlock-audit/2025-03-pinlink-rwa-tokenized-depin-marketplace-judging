# Missing Precision Scaling in globalRewardsPerStaked() Results in Incorrect Reward Distribution

## Summary:
The globalRewardsPerStaked() function returns a value scaled by PRECISION (e.g., 1e18) but does not divide by the scaling factor. This causes rewards to be overstated by a factor of PRECISION, leading to catastrophic miscalculations in reward payouts. Additionally, while globalRewardsPerStakedTarget is guaranteed to be greater than locked under normal conditions, improper handling of deposits could theoretically cause underflow.

## Code Snippet:

## Vulnerability Details:

#### Affected Function:
`globalRewardsPerStaked()`

#### Root Cause:
- **Missing Precision Division**: The function returns self.globalRewardsPerStakedTarget - locked, both of which are scaled up by PRECISION (e.g., 1e18). The result is not divided by PRECISION, leading to values that are PRECISION times larger than intended.
- **Underflow Risk**: If locked ever exceeds globalRewardsPerStakedTarget (e.g., due to overlapping dripping periods from improper deposits), the subtraction globalRewardsPerStakedTarget - locked will underflow, reverting the transaction.

## Impact:
- **Reward Overstatement**: Users receive PRECISION times more rewards than they should (e.g., 1e18x excess).
- **Funds Drain**: Attackers could exploit this to drain the contractâ€™s reward pool.
- **Denial-of-Service**: Underflow scenarios could block legitimate transactions.

## Proof of Concept:

Scenario 1: Incorrect Reward Calculation
**Input:**
- amount = 1000 (reward tokens)
- assetSupply = 1000 (staked tokens)
- PRECISION = 1e18

**Calculation:**
- delta = (1000 * 1e18) / 1000 = 1e18
- globalRewardsPerStakedTarget += 1e18
- After dripping period: globalRewardsPerStaked() returns 1e18 (instead of 1).

**Result:**
A user with 1 staked token would receive 1 * 1e18 rewards (instead of 1 token).

## Mitigation:

**Step 1: Divide by PRECISION in globalRewardsPerStaked()**
```solidity
function globalRewardsPerStaked(RewardsStream storage self) internal view returns (uint256) {
    // ... existing code ...
    return (self.globalRewardsPerStakedTarget - locked) / PRECISION; // Add division
}
```
