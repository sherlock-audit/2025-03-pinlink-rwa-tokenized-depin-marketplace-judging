# seller can increase price to a very high amount

### Summary

the modifylisting function is called by the seller to increase listing price and to set a deadline for  listing, but the issue here is that the seller can unintentionally set the price to a very high amount because the function lacks check to limit the price max increase 
here is the code snipest 
 function modifyListing(bytes32 listingId, uint256 usdPricePerFraction, uint256 newDeadline)
        external
        onlySeller(listingId)
    {
        if (usdPricePerFraction > 0) {
            _listings[listingId].usdPricePerFraction = usdPricePerFraction;
            emit PriceUpdated(listingId, usdPricePerFraction);
        }
        if (newDeadline > 0) {
            require(newDeadline > block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());
            _listings[listingId].deadline = newDeadline;
            emit DeadlineExtended(listingId, newDeadline);
        }
    }

### Root Cause

the function do not implement a maximum price limit

### Internal Pre-conditions

A seller could unintentionally set the price to an extremely high value, either by mistake or due to a misunderstanding of the input value

### External Pre-conditions

A seller could unintentionally set the price to an extremely high value, either by mistake or due to a misunderstanding of the input value

### Attack Path

If a seller sets an excessively high price, it could distort the market for that fractional asset, making it difficult for buyers to engage with the listing. This could lead to a lack of transactions and negatively impact the overall ecosystem.

### Impact

The absence of a maximum price limit means that there is no safeguard against extreme price increases. This could lead to situations where the listing becomes unattractive to buyers, potentially resulting in no sales.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a maximum allowable price for usdPricePerFraction. This could be a fixed value or a configurable parameter that can be adjusted
