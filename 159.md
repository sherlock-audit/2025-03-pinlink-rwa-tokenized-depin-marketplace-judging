# Reward Manipulation Through Frequent Small Withdrawals

## Vulnerability Details

The `withdrawAsset` function in the `PinlinkShop` contract allows users to withdraw assets from the Pinlink ecosystem. While there is no validation to ensure that the withdrawal amount is greater than zero, a more subtle issue exists where users can make frequent small withdrawals to artificially trigger reward updates.

The issue is in the `withdrawAsset` function:

[pinlinkShop.sol::withdrawAsset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L352)

```solidity
function withdrawAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, address receiver) external {
    if (_nonListedBalance(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender) < amount) revert NotEnoughUnlistedTokens();

    // this does't transfer the assets, but only the internal accounting of staking balances
    streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(msg.sender, REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, amount);

    emit FractionsWithdrawn(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, receiver);
    IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(address(this), receiver, tokenId, amount, "");
}
```

When `withdrawAsset` is called, it invokes `transferBalances` which in turn calls `updateRewards` for both the sender and receiver:

```solidity
function transferBalances(RewardsStream storage self, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    self.updateRewards(from);
    self.updateRewards(to);
    self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount;
    self.stakedBalances[to] += amount;
}
```

The vulnerability exists because:
1. Users can call `withdrawAsset` with minimal amounts (e.g., 1 wei) multiple times
2. Each call triggers `updateRewards(from)` and `updateRewards(to)`
3. This allows users to update their rewards at arbitrary times, potentially maximizing their rewards based on the dripping mechanism

## Impact

This vulnerability allows users to manipulate the reward distribution system by:

1. **Optimizing Reward Timing**: Users can strategically update their rewards at the most advantageous times during the dripping period, potentially extracting more rewards than intended.

2. **Gas Cost Exploitation**: The system is designed with the assumption that reward updates happen at natural transaction points (deposits, withdrawals, etc.). By artificially triggering updates with minimal withdrawals, users can bypass the gas costs that would normally limit such behavior.

3. **Reward Calculation Manipulation**: The dripping mechanism is designed to smooth out rewards over time, but frequent updates can allow users to claim rewards at optimal points in the dripping curve.

4. **Unfair Advantage**: Users who understand this vulnerability can gain an advantage over other users who interact with the system as intended.

The economic impact depends on the total value of rewards in the system, but it undermines the fairness of the reward distribution mechanism.

## Mitigation

Several approaches can be implemented to mitigate this vulnerability:

1. **Minimum Withdrawal Amount**: Implement a minimum withdrawal amount that is economically significant enough to discourage frequent small withdrawals:

```solidity
function withdrawAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, address receiver) external {
    if (amount < MINIMUM_WITHDRAWAL_AMOUNT) revert WithdrawalAmountTooSmall();
    if (_nonListedBalance(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender) < amount) revert NotEnoughUnlistedTokens();
    
    // Rest of the function remains the same
    // ...
}
```

2. **Cooldown Period**: Implement a cooldown period between withdrawals for each user:

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) private lastWithdrawalTimestamp;

function withdrawAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, address receiver) external {
    if (block.timestamp < lastWithdrawalTimestamp[msg.sender] + WITHDRAWAL_COOLDOWN) revert WithdrawalCooldownActive();
    lastWithdrawalTimestamp[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
    
    // Rest of the function remains the same
    // ...
}
```

3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement a rate limiting mechanism that restricts the number of withdrawals a user can make within a certain time period.

4. **Batch Reward Updates**: Modify the reward system to update rewards in batches at predetermined intervals rather than on each user action.

By implementing one or more of these mitigations, the system can prevent users from gaming the reward distribution mechanism through frequent small withdrawals.
