# Fee Changes Affect Existing Listings Without Notification

### Summary

The PinlinkShop contract allows administrators to modify the purchase fee percentage at any time, with these changes applying to all existing listings without notification to sellers. 

This will cause a financial impact for sellers as their expected profits will be reduced if the fee is increased before their listing is purchased, without their knowledge or consent.

### Root Cause

The purchase() function calculates fees based on the current value of purchaseFeePerc at the time of purchase rather than the fee percentage in effect when a listing was created. 

The contract lacks a mechanism to store the fee percentage with each listing or to notify sellers when fee changes occur.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A seller has listed an asset for sale through the list() function

The contract owner has the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE which grants access to the setFee() function

Current implementation of _handlePayments() uses the global purchaseFeePerc variable

### External Pre-conditions

An admin with DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE decides to increase the purchase fee percentage

### Attack Path

Seller Alice lists an asset for sale, calculating her price based on the current fee percentage (e.g., 5%)

Admin increases the fee percentage from 5% to 10% by calling setFee(1000)

When a buyer purchases Alice's asset, the higher fee percentage is applied

Alice receives less payment than expected, as 10% is deducted instead of the 5% she anticipated when listing

### Impact

Sellers receive less payment than expected when their listings are purchased

Potential financial losses for sellers who priced their assets accounting for the original fee

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Store fee percentage with each listing or Add a timelock for fee changes
