# Missing Fractional Token Transfer in purchase() Function creates bad User Experience

### Summary

The purchase() function in pinlinkShop.sol fails to transfer ERC1155 tokens to the buyer after a successful purchase. Despite the comment indicating that "buyer receives purchased tokens at the very end," no safeTransferFrom call is implemented to actually transfer the tokens to the buyer.
Comment on line 323 says:
 // buyer receives purchased tokens at the very end (IFractionalAssets.onReceived callback is the most dangerous external call)

But no actual Fractional asset transfer is performed in the purchase function.


### Root Cause

The purchase() function only updates internal accounting via transferBalances() but fails to implement the actual token transfer:

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User A lists  a fragmented asset for sale
2. User B purchases the asset

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Purchasing assets from the shop.

### Impact

- Users pay for assets but don't receive them automatically
- Purchased tokens remain locked in the contract until users manually withdraw them
- Users must perform an additional transaction (withdrawAsset()) to receive tokens they've already paid for
- Poor user experience and potential loss of funds if users are unaware of the withdrawal requirement

### PoC

function test_purchase_doesntChangeActualTokenBalance() public {
        // Check buyer's actual token balance before purchase
        uint256 bobTokenBalanceBefore = fractions.balanceOf(bob, asset1);
        
        // Check buyer's internal unlisted balance before purchase
        uint256 unlistedBalanceBefore = _unlistedBalance(address(fractions), asset1, bob);
        
        // Perform purchase
        uint256 buyAmount = 5;
        _doPurchase(listingId3, buyAmount, bob);
        
        // Verify internal accounting is updated
        assertEq(_unlistedBalance(address(fractions), asset1, bob), unlistedBalanceBefore + buyAmount);
        
        // Verify buyer's actual token balance remains unchanged (still 0)
        assertEq(fractions.balanceOf(bob, asset1), bobTokenBalanceBefore);
        
        // Verify pshop contract still holds all the tokens
        uint256 pshopBalanceAfter = fractions.balanceOf(address(pshop), asset1);
        assertGt(pshopBalanceAfter, 0);
        
        // To get actual tokens, bob would need to call withdrawAsset
        vm.prank(bob);
        pshop.withdrawAsset(address(fractions), asset1, 1, bob);
        
        // Now bob's actual token balance should increase
        assertEq(fractions.balanceOf(bob, asset1), bobTokenBalanceBefore + 1);
    }

### Mitigation

Implement actual token transfer to the buyer at the end of the purchase() function.
