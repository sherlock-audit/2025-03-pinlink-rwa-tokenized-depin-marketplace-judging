# Slippage may occur when selling FractionalAssets tokens.

### Summary

In the Pinlink ecosystem, all transactions are conducted using PIN tokens. 
The buyer pays with PIN tokens to purchase FractionalAssets tokens from the seller. 
This transaction takes place in the purchase() function of the PinlinkShop.sol contract. 
This function performs checks to protect for slippage when a buyer pays for PIN tokens.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L288
```solidity
function purchase(bytes32 listingId, uint256 fractionsAmount, uint256 maxTotalPinAmount) external {
        ...
        if (totalPinPayment > maxTotalPinAmount) revert SlippageExceeded();
	...
}
```
However, there is no slippage protection check for the seller.
The seller sets the USD price per FractionalAssets token when listing FractionalAssets tokens for sale.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L236
```solidity
function list(
        address fractionalAssets,
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 usdPricePerFraction, //<@attention
        uint256 deadline
    ) external returns (bytes32 listingId) {
        listingId = _list(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, usdPricePerFraction, deadline);
}
```
However, the seller does not receive USD when selling FractionalAssets tokens; instead, receive PIN tokens. 
Therefore, when listing FractionalAssets tokens, the seller will set the USD price per FractionalAssets token by calculating the minimum amount of PIN tokens they want to receive.
If the USD price per PIN token increases before the FractionalAssets tokens are sold, the seller will not receive the expected amount of PIN tokens. 
Thus, slippage occurs for the seller. 
Since all transactions in the pinlink echosystem are conducted by using PIN tokens, the seller must perform slippage protection checks on PIN tokens just like the buyer.


### Root Cause

none

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. A seller lists 50 FractionalAssets tokens with a price per FractionalAssets token of 1000$.
The USD price per PIN token is 1$. The amount of PIN tokens the seller wants to receive is 47500.
2. The USD price per PIN token increases to 2$.
3. The buyer buys 50 FractionalAssets tokens.

The seller receives 23750 PIN tokens, which is less than expected.

### Impact

Slippage may occur for the seller when selling FractionalAssets tokens.


### PoC

```solidity
function test() public {
        uint256 FEE_DENOMINATOR = 10_000;
        uint256 purchaseFeePerc = 500;

        vm.startPrank(admin);

        oracle.updateTokenPrice(1e18);

        pshop.enableAsset(address(fractions), asset1, admin);
        bytes32 listingId = pshop.list(address(fractions), asset1, 50, 1000e18, block.timestamp + 7 days);

        console.log("Expected PIN Token Amount : ", oracle.convertFromUsd(address(PIN), 50 * 1000e18) * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR);

        oracle.updateTokenPrice(2e18); //price increase

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        pshop.purchase(listingId, 50, type(uint256).max);

        console.log("Received PIN Token Amount : ", PIN.balanceOf(admin));
}

Logs:
  Expected PIN Token Amount :  47500000000000000000000
  Received PIN Token Amount :  23750000000000000000000
```
