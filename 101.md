# Last admin can permanently brick core functionality in PinlinkShop and FractionalAssets contracts

### Summary

The lack of checks to prevent the removal of the last admin role holder will cause a permanent loss of admin functionality for the PinlinkShop and FractionalAssets contracts as the last account with DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE can renounce their role, making critical protocol management functions permanently inaccessible.

### Root Cause

In `PinlinkShop:155` and `FractionalAssets:18`, the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE is granted without implementing any safeguards against removing the last admin. OpenZeppelin's AccessControl allows any role holder to renounce their own role, and there are no checks to prevent the last admin from doing so.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. At least one account has the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE in each contract
2. The account with DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE calls renounceRole to remove their own role

### External Pre-conditions

None are required, only internal conditions need to be met. 

### Attack Path

1. The last admin calls `renounceRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, adminAddress)` on the affected contract
2. The AccessControl.renounceRole function succeeds, removing the role from the account
3. DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE is now not assigned to any accounts
4. All admin functions requiring onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) modifier become permanently inaccessible


### Impact

The protocol suffers a permanent loss of admin capabilities which would be the following:

For PinlinkShop:

- The fee receiver cannot be updated (`setFeeReceiver()`)
- Purchase fees cannot be modified (`setFee()`)
- Oracle integrations cannot be updated (`setOracle()`)
- New assets cannot be enabled (`enableAsset()`)
- Erroneously sent tokens cannot be rescued (`rescueToken()`)

For FractionalAssets:

- Contract URI cannot be updated (`updateContractURI()`)
- New admin or minter roles cannot be granted


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Override the `_revokeRole` function in both contracts to prevent removing the last admin
