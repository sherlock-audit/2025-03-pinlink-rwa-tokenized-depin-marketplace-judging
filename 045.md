# Purchaser cannot resale assets bought

## Description
In the purchase function, a buyer successfully acquires fractional assets from the seller, but the contract does not allow or facilitate resale of those assets. This happens due to no transfer of ownership and no mechanism defined to handle resale of assets bought.
