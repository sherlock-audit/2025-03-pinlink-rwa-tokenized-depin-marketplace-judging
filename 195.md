# Stale Price Risk in CentralizedOracle.sol does not revert

# Summary
The ``CentralizedOracle.sol`` contract does not revert when the price is stale but instead returns ``0``. This can lead to incorrect calculations in dependent contracts that rely on this oracle for price data.

# Finding Description

The ``CentralizedOracle`` contract provides price data to other contracts. However, it does not implement a mechanism to reject stale prices explicitly. When a price is outdated, the contract returns ``0`` instead of reverting or signaling an error.  leading to inaccurate transactions and financial losses.

- The ``convertToUsd`` and ``convertFromUsd`` functions return 0 if the price is stale (i.e., ``lastPriceUpdateTimestamp`` is older than ``STALENESS_THRESHOLD``).
- This behavior can be exploited to cause incorrect calculations in the ``PinlinkShop`` contract, such as allowing purchases at a price of ``0``.

- Proof of Concept (PoC):
```solidity
// Price becomes stale after 7 days
uint256 stalePrice = oracle.convertToUsd(token, 1e18); // Returns 0
```

This could allow users to purchase assets for free or at incorrect prices.

# Recommendation

- Revert on Stale Prices: Instead of returning ``0``, revert when a price is outdated.

- Emit an Event: Notify dependent contracts when a price is stale.
