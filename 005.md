# setupPinlinkShop.s.sol --Hardcoded dependencies and centralized control pattern in `PinlinkShopSetupScript` introduces deployment fragility and security risk

### Summary

The `PinlinkShopSetupScript.s.sol` deployment script (Lines 9–44) https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/pinlinkshop/setupPinlinkShop.s.sol#L9-L44

hardcodes several critical production contract addresses and assigns centralized asset controls and fee collection authority directly to developer-owned EOAs (`DEV_WALLET` and `FRONT_WALLET`). This configuration creates operational fragility, potential loss of control in cross-environment deployment, and exposes risk in case of EOA compromise.

Furthermore, the script assigns initial asset control and fee authority without any verification logic, dynamic configuration injection, or multisig protection, making it prone to error and centralization risk during production rollout.



### Root Cause

 • Line 10: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/pinlinkshop/setupPinlinkShop.s.sol#L10

`address FRONT_WALLET = 0x8754Dd14aB904d970860C02f76164293da9727F0;`

A static EOA is hardcoded as an asset admin, with no validation logic or vault fallback strategy.
 • Lines 14-16: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/pinlinkshop/setupPinlinkShop.s.sol#L14-L16

`address pinOracle = 0xc13827D7B2Cd3309952352D0C030e96bc7b9fcF5;`
`FractionalAssets fractionalAssets = FractionalAssets(0x82C4b8FF3C9016C775eD160D8D40E2614c44b9BA);`
`PinlinkShop pshop = PinlinkShop(0x46564999721055c7E5C32d857BCf766Aa4A4f626);`

All contracts are directly hardcoded instead of being passed as environment variables or network registry lookups, making reusability fragile across environments.

 • Lines 28–39: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/pinlinkshop/setupPinlinkShop.s.sol#L28-L39

`pshop.enableAsset(address(fractionalAssets), tokenId, adminWallet);`

All assets are mapped to two EOAs, which if compromised, allow full transfer, disablement, or mismanagement of listed assets.

 • Line 42 : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/pinlinkshop/setupPinlinkShop.s.sol#L42

`pshop.setFeeReceiver(DEV_WALLET);`

Centralizes fee control without protection, posing an unnecessary point of failure.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Deployer runs this script without modifying static addresses.
 2. Assets are initialized using the script as-is in production deployment.
 3. `DEV_WALLET` and `FRONT_WALLET` are not protected by multisig or role separation.



### External Pre-conditions

1. One of the EOAs (e.g., `FRONT_WALLET`) is compromised.

2. A contract address referenced in Lines 14–16 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/pinlinkshop/setupPinlinkShop.s.sol#L14-L16 
is no longer valid (e.g., expired proxy, wrong chain).

3.Deployment occurs without additional safety checks or multisig relayers.

### Attack Path

 1. Malicious actor compromises `FRONT_WALLET.`
 2. Attacker gains asset admin rights for tokens: 2889119958, 2418779085, 182352940, 3252672878.
 3. Assets can be rerouted, burned, or manipulated at marketplace level.
 4. Separately, if `DEV_WALLET` is lost or misconfigured, fees cannot be retrieved and asset mapping is non-recoverable.



### Impact

• Centralization of control introduces single-point-of-failure for asset admin and fees.
• Hardcoded contracts make the script prone to accidental misdeployment.
• Assets enabled to EOAs become high-risk targets in production environments.

`address FRONT_WALLET = 0x8754Dd14aB904d970860C02f76164293da9727F0;`

// Line 16: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/pinlinkshop/setupPinlinkShop.s.sol#L16

// Lines 35-38:  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/pinlinkshop/setupPinlinkShop.s.sol#L35-L38

`pshop.enableAsset(address(fractionalAssets), 2889119958, FRONT_WALLET);`
`pshop.enableAsset(address(fractionalAssets), 2418779085, FRONT_WALLET);`
`pshop.enableAsset(address(fractionalAssets), 182352940, FRONT_WALLET);`
`pshop.enableAsset(address(fractionalAssets), 3252672878, FRONT_WALLET);`

These token-to-wallet mappings grant total control to a single static EOA without multisig protection.



### Mitigation

 • Replace all static addresses with vm.envAddress() or network registry resolution.

address `FRONT_WALLET = vm.envAddress("PIN_FRONT_ADMIN");`


 • Replace hardcoded contract instantiations with dynamic injection:

`PinlinkShop pshop = PinlinkShop(vm.envAddress("PINSHOP_CONTRACT"));`

• Require all admin wallets to be multisig-controlled or deployable via timelock contract.
 • Add sanity checks in the script’s `run()` flow to verify proper network and contract validity before enabling assets.
