# Admin will permanently lose funds through zero address interactions

### Summary

Missing zero-address validations will cause permanent fund loss as admins could accidentally send tokens to inaccessible addresses or set critical contract parameters to invalid values.


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L379

### Root Cause

In [pinklink_audit/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace-king-null/pinklink_audit/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L498-L503) the rescueToken function and constructor lack proper address validation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The rescueToken function doesn't validate the recipient address
The constructor doesn't validate that input addresses are non-zero
The contract has accumulated tokens that need rescuing



### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

An admin calls rescueToken with a valid token but with destination to = address(0)
All tokens of that type are transferred to the zero address
The tokens are permanently lost with no recovery mechanism
Similar loss can occur during deployment if critical address parameters are set to zero

### Impact

Permanent loss of any tokens present in the contract, potentially worth thousands or millions depending on contract usage and token value.

### PoC

```solidity
function testRescueTokenToZeroAddress() public {
    // Setup: transfer some tokens to the shop contract
    ERC20Mock token = new ERC20Mock("Test", "TEST");
    token.mint(address(shop), 1000e18);
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(shop)), 1000e18);
    
    // Admin accidentally rescues to zero address
    vm.prank(admin);
    shop.rescueToken(address(token), address(0));
    
    // Tokens are now lost forever
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(0)), 1000e18);
    assertEq(token.balanceOf(address(shop)), 0);
}


```

### Mitigation

Add zero-address validation in the rescueToken function:
