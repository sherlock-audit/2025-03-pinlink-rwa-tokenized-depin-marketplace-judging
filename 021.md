# Frontrunning attack prevents purchase of all available fractions leading to DoS

## Description:
The PinLink protocol is vulnerable to a DoS attack that prevents users from purchasing all available fractions of an asset. When a user attempts to buy the exact amount of fractions available in a listing (i.e., all remaining fractions), an attacker can monitor the mempool and frontrun the transaction by purchasing a small amount of fractions from the same listing.
This vulnerability exists because the purchase function strictly enforces that the requested amount must not exceed the available amount:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L305
```solidity
function purchase(bytes32 listingId, uint256 fractionsAmount, uint256 maxTotalPinAmount) external {
    // ...
    {
        // to prevent stack too deep
        uint256 listedAmount = listing.amount;
        if (listedAmount < fractionsAmount) revert NotEnoughTokens();
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}
}
```

When the attacker's transaction executes first, it reduces the `listing.amount`, causing the victim's transaction to revert with the `NotEnoughTokens` error. This is particularly problematic for users who want to purchase the entire available supply of fractions at once.
The attack requires minimal resources from the attacker (they only need to purchase a small amount) but can cause significant disruption to legitimate buyers who wish to purchase all available fractions. The attack can be repeated to persistently block such transactions.

## Impact:
Users attempting to purchase all available fractions of an asset cannot complete their transactions if frontrun

## Recommended Mitigation:
Add support for purchasing all available fractions regardless of the exact amount
