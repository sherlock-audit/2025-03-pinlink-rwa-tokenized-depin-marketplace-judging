# Protocol overcharge fee

### Summary

In pinklinkShop.sol _handlePayments() fee calculated in a following way:
```solidity
    function _handlePayments(address buyer, address seller, uint256 totalPinPayment)
        internal
        returns (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees)
    {
        // fees are rounded in favor of the protocol
        paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
        fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;

        // no need to verfy that msg.value==0, because purchases with tokens are done with purchaseWithToken() which is non-payable
        IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, paymentForSeller);
        IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, feeReceiver, fees);
    }
```
Where totalPinPayment = amount of fractions x pin price.

The problem with such approach is that totalPinPayment is total amount which already suppose to include fee, so essentially formula calculates "clean" seller income base on percentage from amount with fee, hence, if amount bigger than it should be -> fee will be bigger.


### Root Cause

pinklinkShop.sol 
```solidity
    function _handlePayments(address buyer, address seller, uint256 totalPinPayment)
        internal
        returns (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees)
    {
        // fees are rounded in favor of the protocol
        paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
        fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;

        // no need to verfy that msg.value==0, because purchases with tokens are done with purchaseWithToken() which is non-payable
        IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, paymentForSeller);
        IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, feeReceiver, fees);
    }
```

### Attack Path

Will happens itself every purchase 

### Impact

fee overcharged

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use such formula instead amount x fee/(fee+10 000)
