# CentralizedOracle.sol-- Centralized price control and unchecked trust assumptions pose critical systemic risks

### Summary

The CentralizedOracle contract relies entirely on a single privileged owner to update the PIN/USD price without any decentralized verification mechanism or sanity fallback. This design introduces a centralized trust bottleneck, where one compromised or negligent owner can disrupt all downstream pricing logic, minting mechanics, reward distributions, and asset valuations.

Also, the contract lacks:
 • A robust external validation mechanism (e.g., DEX price crosscheck, TWAP feed, Chainlink fallback)
 • Any form of update frequency enforcement or rate limiter
 • Access control override circuit breaker in the event the owner’s key is compromised

These design decisions introduce systemic fragility across the protocol where a single malicious update or staleness error can invalidate multiple critical systems.

 • Line 52: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L52

`function updateTokenPrice(uint256 usdPerToken) external onlyOwner {`


 • Line 56-57: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L56-L57

`if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();`
`if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();`


 • No use of DEX verification, TWAP, Chainlink, or multi-sig validation
 • No access timeouts, timelocks, or quorum mechanisms



### Internal Pre-conditions

 • Owner has access and permission to update price at any time
 • System design trusts that owner acts in good faith and avoids error



### External Pre-conditions

 • Other protocol components (minting, listing, rewards) depend on this oracle’s price
 • Price is updated manually without decentralized anchoring



### Attack Path

 1. Malicious owner or compromised key pushes manipulated USD price (e.g., 1000x higher or near-zero within allowed range).
 2. Price-dependent subsystems (e.g., minting ratios, asset valuations, reward streams) misbehave, triggering massive value misallocations.
 3. No fallback logic, circuit breaker, or validation process stops this—system-wide failure ensues.



### Impact

 • Protocol-wide value distortion across all PIN/USD-dependent logic
 • Potential for rugpull-style price manipulation from a single EOA
 • Silent degradation via stale price (if owner becomes inactive)
 • Loss of user trust in valuation logic and reward distribution fairness


### PoC

// attacker compromises the owner's key
`centralizedOracle.updateTokenPrice(1e30);` // artificially inflates price, distorts minting
// or lets price go stale for > 7 days — protocol continues with broken price logic

### Mitigation

 • Integrate a Chainlink price feed fallback or DEX-based TWAP validation to anchor the price.
 • Use a multi-sig ownership model or time-delayed updates with community veto options.
 • Add an emergency `pausePriceUpdates()` circuit breaker.
 • Consider integrating on-chain verification against Uniswap spot price as hinted in comments.
 • Emit a `PriceUpdateQueued()` event with delay window before finalization (anti-rug measure).
