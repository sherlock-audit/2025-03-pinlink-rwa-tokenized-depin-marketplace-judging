# Unbounded loop in `PinLinkShop::claimRewardsMultiple` can prevent reward claims

### Summary

The unbounded loop in the `PinLinkShop::claimRewardsMultiple` function will cause a denial of service for users with many `tokenIds` as the transaction will revert due to exceeding the block gas limit when attempting to claim rewards for too many tokens simultaneously.

### Root Cause

In `PinlinkShop.sol::claimRewardsMultiple` line 337 the function contains an unbounded loop that processes an array of tokenIds without any limit on the array size.

```solidity
@> function claimRewardsMultiple(address fractionalAssets, uint256[] calldata tokenIds) external {
        uint256 totalClaimed;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
            // stream.claimRewards resets the rewards, so no harm in putting the same tokenId multiple times
            uint256 claimed = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenIds[i]].claimRewards(msg.sender);
            totalClaimed += claimed;
            // we emit here individual events for each tokenId for accountability reasons
            emit Claimed(fractionalAssets, tokenIds[i], msg.sender, claimed);
        }
        IERC20(REWARDS_TOKEN).safeTransfer(msg.sender, totalClaimed);
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to own or have accrued rewards for a large number of token IDs
2. The user must attempt to claim rewards for all these tokens in a single transaction



### External Pre-conditions

1. Ethereum block gas limit must be at its standard level (currently around 30M gas)

### Attack Path

1. User owns or has accumulated rewards for a large number of tokens
2. User attempts to call `claimRewardsMultiple` with all their `tokenIds` in a single transaction
3. As the loop processes more and more `tokenIds`, the cumulative gas consumption increases linearly
4. Once the gas usage approaches the block gas limit (typically around 30M gas), the transaction reverts
5. The user is unable to claim any rewards, resulting in a denial of service

### Impact

The users cannot claim their rightful rewards for multiple assets in a single transaction if they own or have accrued rewards for too many `tokenIds`, forcing them to split claims across multiple transactions with higher gas costs or potentially being unable to claim some rewards at all if they cannot determine the optimal batching strategy.

### Mitigation

Add a maximum limit to the array size in the `claimRewardsMultiple`.
