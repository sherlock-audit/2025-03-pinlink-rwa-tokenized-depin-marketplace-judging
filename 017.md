# Protocol assumption about `FractionalAsset`'s `totalSupply` can be broken, which leads to incorrect rewards distribution

### Summary

After the `FractionalAsset` is deployed and minted the `totalSupply` of the asset should be immutable as the protocol claims.

```markdown
The total stakedBalance of an asset should not change once it is enabled, and should match the assetSupply.
```

```markdown
The FractionalAsset is expected to comply with ERC1155, of fixed (immutable) totalSupply for each of the tokenIds. Once minted, the number of fractions is immutable.
```

However, the `totalSupply` of the asset can be changed after the asset is minted. User can transfer asset to `address(0)` which will decrease the token `totalSupply` due to the fact that `FractionalAsset` inherits the `ERC1155Supply` extension which can modify token `totalSupply`.

```solidity
function _update(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256[] memory ids,
        uint256[] memory values
    ) internal virtual override {
        ERC1155Supply._update(from, to, ids, values);
    }
```

```solidity
function _update(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256[] memory ids,
        uint256[] memory values
    ) internal virtual override {
        super._update(from, to, ids, values);

        if (from == address(0)) {
            uint256 totalMintValue = 0;
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
                uint256 value = values.unsafeMemoryAccess(i);
                // Overflow check required: The rest of the code assumes that totalSupply never overflows
                _totalSupply[ids.unsafeMemoryAccess(i)] += value;
                totalMintValue += value;
            }
            // Overflow check required: The rest of the code assumes that totalSupplyAll never overflows
            _totalSupplyAll += totalMintValue;
        }

        if (to == address(0)) {
            uint256 totalBurnValue = 0;
            for (uint256 i = 0; i < ids.length; ++i) {
                uint256 value = values.unsafeMemoryAccess(i);

                unchecked {
                    // Overflow not possible: values[i] <= balanceOf(from, ids[i]) <= totalSupply(ids[i])
                    _totalSupply[ids.unsafeMemoryAccess(i)] -= value;
                    // Overflow not possible: sum_i(values[i]) <= sum_i(totalSupply(ids[i])) <= totalSupplyAll
                    totalBurnValue += value;
                }
            }
            unchecked {
                // Overflow not possible: totalBurnValue = sum_i(values[i]) <= sum_i(totalSupply(ids[i])) <= totalSupplyAll
                _totalSupplyAll -= totalBurnValue;
            }
        }
    }
```

We can see that the `totalSupply` of an asset can be decreased when the token is transfered to `address(0)`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Asset must be minted with expected totalSupply and must be enabled in `pinlinkShop`

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User has any amount of the `FractionalAsset`
2. User sends it to `address(0)` changing the immutable totalSupply
3. Now the real totalSupply is smaller but the rewards are still distributed based on "immutable" totalSupply which leads to incorrect reward distribution

### Impact

Protocol invairant can be broken which will break the protocol assumptions about the real `totalSupply` of the asset. The `totalSupply` should be immutable and once the assset is enabled in the `pinlinkShop` the `assetSupply` can't be changed in that contract.

The issue is that, the `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` will earn part of the rewards, which are meant for the `FractionalAsset` holder, even when the token `totalSupply` is lower. `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` is meant to receive rewards for all the tokens that are out of the staking system but it will also earn part of the rewards when the token was burned and the real `totalSupply` is lower.

`REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` will earn rewards for tokens that do not exits anymore and normal `FractionalAsset` holder will not earn correct amount of rewards.  When the real `totalSupply` becomes lower, the `assetSupply` will not be updated in `pinlinkShop` so if it was set at 100 users will always earn rewards, which are split to 100 tokens even when the real `totalSupply` can be smaller, for example 99.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Do not allow transfers to `address(0)` which will change the `totalSupply` which should be immutable after mint.
