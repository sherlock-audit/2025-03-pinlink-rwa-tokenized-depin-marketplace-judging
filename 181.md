# Potential Front-running & MEV Attacks on Price Updates

## Description
The CentralizedOracle contract allows the owner to update the price of the token through the updateTokenPrice function. This process is vulnerable to front-running and Miner Extractable Value (MEV) attacks. If a trader observes an incoming price update transaction, they can exploit this information to buy tokens before a price increase or sell tokens before a price decrease, leading to unfair advantages and potential financial losses for other users.

## Impact
Front-running: Traders can exploit the time delay between the price update transaction being broadcasted and confirmed on the blockchain.
MEV Exploitation: Miners or validators can reorder transactions to their advantage, leading to unfair market conditions.
Market Manipulation: The ability to predict price changes can lead to significant market manipulation and loss of trust in the oracle.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L11

Monitor Transactions: A trader monitors the mempool for incoming updateTokenPrice transactions.
Front-run Transaction: The trader submits a transaction to buy tokens before the price increase or sell tokens before the price decrease.
Profit from Price Change: The trader profits from the price change, exploiting the information before it is reflected in the market.

## Exploit Scenario
The owner submits a transaction to update the token price from 1 USD to 2 USD.
A trader monitoring the mempool sees the transaction and submits a buy order for the token before the price update is confirmed.
The price update is confirmed, and the trader sells the tokens at the new higher price, making a profit at the expense of other market participants.

## Mitigation
Implement Commit-Reveal Scheme: Use a commit-reveal scheme for price updates. In this scheme, the owner first commits to a price update by submitting a hash of the new price. After a certain period, the owner reveals the actual price, preventing front-running.
Introduce Time-Locked Updates: Implement time-locked updates so that price changes are not instant. This gives the market time to adjust and reduces the risk of front-running.
Code Example for Mitigation
Commit-Reveal Scheme Implementation
```solidity
// ...existing code...

contract CentralizedOracle is IPinlinkOracle, ERC165, Ownable {
    // ...existing code...

    bytes32 public priceCommitment;
    uint256 public committedPrice;
    uint256 public commitTimestamp;
    uint256 public constant COMMIT_PERIOD = 1 hours;

    event PriceCommitted(bytes32 commitment);
    event PriceRevealed(uint256 price);

    function commitPriceUpdate(bytes32 commitment) external onlyOwner {
        priceCommitment = commitment;
        commitTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        emit PriceCommitted(commitment);
    }

    function revealPriceUpdate(uint256 usdPerToken, bytes32 nonce) external onlyOwner {
        require(block.timestamp >= commitTimestamp + COMMIT_PERIOD, "Commit period not yet passed");
        require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(usdPerToken, nonce)) == priceCommitment, "Invalid commitment");

        uint256 _currentPrice = _tokenPriceInUsd;
        if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
        if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();

        _tokenPriceInUsd = usdPerToken;
        lastPriceUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        emit PriceRevealed(usdPerToken);
        emit PriceUpdated(usdPerToken);
    }

    // ...existing code...
}
```
By implementing these mitigations, the contract can reduce the risk of front-running and MEV attacks, ensuring a fairer and more secure price update mechanism.
