# Repeated Listing Calls will bloat storage for Marketplace Contracts

## Summary
The absence of a check to reuse a listing when its amount reaches zero will cause a storage bloat for Marketplace Contracts as Active Sellers repeatedly create new listings for the same asset. This leads to the unbounded growth of the internal _listings mapping over time, potentially increasing gas costs for storage operations.

## Root case
In [Marketplace Contracts Repository](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/tree/main/marketplace-contracts) the list function fails to verify whether an existing listing with amount = 0 can be reused. As a result, after all shares are sold and the listing’s amount becomes zero, subsequent calls to list (in a new block, due to block.number change) create a new listing entry instead of reusing the existing one.

## Internal Pre-conditions
1. Active Seller needs to call the list function to create a new listing for an asset that was previously listed and sold out (i.e., its amount is now 0).
2. Active Seller needs to repeatedly perform listing operations (in successive blocks) so that multiple empty entries accumulate in the _listings mapping.

## External Pre-conditions
There are no external pre-conditions as this issue solely pertains to the contract's internal storage management and design, independent of external protocol states.

## Attack path
1. An Active Seller calls the list function to list an asset with a positive amount.
2. The asset is sold, reducing the listing's amount to 0, yet the listing remains stored in _listings.
3. In a subsequent block, the Active Seller calls list again with the same parameters.
4. Due to the change in block.number, a new listingId is generated even though an existing (empty) listing for the same asset exists.
5. Repeating this process leads to an accumulation of redundant (empty) listing entries in the _listings mapping.

## Impact
The Marketplace Contracts suffer a degradation in storage efficiency due to the unbounded growth of the _listings mapping. Although each empty listing occupies only a small amount of storage, in scenarios with highly active sellers repeatedly creating listings, this may lead to increased gas costs for operations that iterate or query these mappings.

## PoC
1. An Active Seller calls list(asset, price, amount) where amount > 0.
2. The asset is completely sold, and the listing’s amount becomes 0.
3. In the next block, the Active Seller calls list(asset, price, amount) again with the same parameters.
4. A new listing is created (with a different listingId) even though an empty listing already exists for the same asset and seller.
5. Repeating these steps demonstrates the growth of the _listings mapping with multiple empty entries.

## Mitigation
1. Implement a Reuse Check: Modify the list function to check for an existing listing with amount = 0 for the same asset and seller. If such a listing exists, update or reuse it instead of creating a new entry.
2. Introduce Cleanup Mechanisms: Alternatively, consider implementing a cleanup mechanism that resets or archives empty listing entries to prevent unbounded storage growth.
3. Optimize Data Structures: Evaluate alternative data structures or indexing strategies that can handle stale entries more efficiently without affecting the contract’s operational integrity.
