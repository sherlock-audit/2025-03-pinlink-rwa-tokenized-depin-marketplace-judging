# Unpredictable Fee (purchaseFeePerc) Endanger Sellers’ Revenue

### Summary

The failure to lock `purchaseFeePerc` at listing creation will cause unexpected revenue loss for sellers as an authorized admin can change the fee after the listing has been created.

### Root Cause

When the buyer calls the `purchase()` function, `_handlePayments()` determines how much of the total payment goes to the seller and how much is deducted as a fee. Specifically:

Because the fee is derived from the seller’s total payment, any increase in `purchaseFeePerc` directly reduces the amount the seller receives.

In the setFee function allows dynamically changing `purchaseFeePerc` at any time **without any mechanism to lock it in when a listing is created**. As a result, sellers cannot rely on the fee being stable from listing to purchase execution.

Because the seller ultimately bears this fee (deducted from their revenue), **its unpredictable and fluctuating nature directly risks causing unexpected shortfalls for the seller, and the final income they receive may deviate from the `usdPricePerFraction` they originally anticipated at the time of listing.**


### Internal Pre-conditions

An admin calls `setFee()` to set `purchaseFeePerc` to a higher value after the seller has already listed items.

### Path
1. Seller creates a listing expecting a certain fee (e.g., 5%).
2. Admin calls `setFee()` to raise `purchaseFeePerc` to a higher value (e.g., 10%).
3. Buyer calls `purchase()` on the existing listing, triggering the `_handlePayments()` function.
4. Seller now receives less revenue than expected, due to the changed fee.

### Impact

The seller suffers a revenue loss, as the higher protocol-level purchase fee reduces the net amount they receive. This can undermine seller confidence or distrust of the platform.

### PoC

```solidity
// Step 1: Seller lists an item  
pinlinkShop._list(  
    fractionalAssets,  
    tokenId,  
    amount,  
    usdPricePerFraction,  
    deadline  
);  

// Step 2: Admin updates fee (raising it significantly)  
pinlinkShop.setFee(10000);  // e.g., 10%

// Step 3: Buyer purchases  
pinlinkShop.purchase(listingId, fractionsAmount, maxTotalPinAmount);  

// Seller observes reduced revenue due to the new fee.

```

### Mitigation

Lock the fee at the time of listing creation by storing the effective fee in the Listing struct. Use that locked fee in `_handlePayments()` instead of relying on the mutable global `purchaseFeePerc`.
