# USDC blacklist prevents reward claims

### Summary

The contract distributes rewards exclusively in USDC (REWARDS_TOKEN). Since USDC is a centralized token, addresses can be blacklisted by Circle, the USDC issuer. If a blacklisted user tries to claim their rewards via claimRewards(), the transaction fails due to USDC’s internal blacklist mechanism. As a result, users lose access to their earned rewards, and rewards may become permanently stuck.

### Root Cause

The contract uses USDC (a centralized ERC-20 token) as REWARDS_TOKEN.
USDC has a blacklist mechanism that prevents transfers to or from blacklisted addresses.
claimRewards() calls safeTransfer() with USDC, which fails if the recipient (msg.sender) is blacklisted.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract must be initialized with USDC as the REWARDS_TOKEN.
A user must have claimable rewards in the contract’s streams mapping.

### External Pre-conditions

The user claiming rewards (msg.sender) must be blacklisted.
The user must call claimRewards() or claimRewardsMultiple().

### Attack Path

A user accumulates claimable USDC rewards in the contract.
If blacklisted attempts to claim rewards, the USDC contract rejects the transfer, reverting the transaction.
The user cannot access their rewards.

### Impact

Users affected by the USDC blacklist lose their rewards permanently.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modified rescueToken() (Allows Admin to Extract Rewards).

```diff
    function rescueToken(address erc20Token, address to) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
-       if (erc20Token == address(REWARDS_TOKEN)) revert InvalidParameter();

        // PIN is not expected to stay in this contract balance, so it is ok to recover
        IERC20(erc20Token).safeTransfer(to, IERC20(erc20Token).balanceOf(address(this)));
    }
```
