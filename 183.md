# Seller will steal buyer's slippage tolerance through price manipulation

### Summary

In the contract file `PinlinkShop`. The absence of price update delay mechanisms in `modifyListing` function will cause financial loss for buyers as sellers can front-run purchase transactions to maximize price within slippage limits.


### Root Cause

In the `modifyListing` function allows immediate price updates without delay/cooldown. The design choice to enable real-time price adjustments is flawed as it creates MEV (Miner Extractable Value) opportunities for sellers.

Because the `modifyListing` function allows immediate price changes without delay or cooldown, a malicious seller can raise the listing price at the final moment to exploit the buyer’s slippage tolerance (`maxTotalPinAmount`). The difference between the original expected price and the last-minute increase is effectively “stolen” from the buyer’s slippage setting, allowing the seller to capture that value as MEV.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Seller must have active listing with `amount > 0`
2. Buyer must set `maxTotalPinAmount` above current oracle-converted price

### Attack Path

1. Seller monitors mempool for `purchase()` transactions
2. Buyer submits purchase with `maxTotalPinAmount = X + 5%` tolerance
3. Seller's MEV bot calculates optimal price increase:
4. newPrice = `min(currentPrice * 1.049, maxTotalPinAmount)`
5. Seller calls `modifyListing()` with 20% higher gas fee
6. Miner includes seller's price update before buyer's purchase
7. Purchase executes at 4.9% higher price (just below buyer's 5% tolerance)

### Impact

Buyers suffer 80-100% loss of their slippage tolerance (typically 1-5% of transaction value). For a $100k purchase with 3% slippage setting:

Maximum loss: $3,000 per transaction
Attacker gain: $2,940 (98% of lost slippage)
Protocol fee: $60 (2% of lost slippage)

### Mitigation

Implementing a 24-hour delay for price updates effectively prevents front-running attacks, ensures both buyers and sellers clearly understand the pricing window, and has minimal impact on legitimate trades.

```solidity
/// with a 24-hour delay for the new price to take effect  
function modifyListing(  
    bytes32 listingId,  
    uint256 usdPricePerFraction,  
    uint256 newDeadline  
) external onlySeller(listingId) {  
    // If a price update is requested, 
    //store the new price and its activation time in the pending fields  
    if (usdPricePerFraction > 0) {  
        _listings[listingId].pendingUsdPrice = usdPricePerFraction;  
        
        // Set the new price's activation time to current time plus 24 hours  
        _listings[listingId].priceActivationTime = block.timestamp + 24 hours;  
        emit PriceUpdated(listingId, usdPricePerFraction);  
    }  
    ...  
}
