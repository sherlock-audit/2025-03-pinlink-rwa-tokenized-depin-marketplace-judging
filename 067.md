# Staleness Threshold is too big and can lead to DOS of updateTokenPrice function

### Summary

Analyzing the PIN token price volatility we can spot that the PIN token price can change drastically over one week period. But the `STALENESS_THRESHOLD` inside the `Centralized Oracle` contract is equal to 7 days. This leads to potential big price diffrence between actual price and current price inside oracle. Also after the oracle is stale (the price oracle is not updated for more than 7 days), the updateTokenPrice function can revert even though the new submitted price is correct.

### Root Cause

By analyzing the price of the PIN token we can see that during around 7 days there are instances where price drops by 50% (See pinned image).
Because of that price can be not updated for 6 days and it is still be considered correct. But from the price analysis we can see that this threshold is too big and diffrence between actual price nad current price can lead to too much or too little amount of PIN tokens to be send to the seller. 
Because of such a big STALENESS_THRESHOLD it is possible that during the 7 days that the price wasn't updated, the price dropped by sligthly more than 80%. But due to the internal check inside the  `CentralizedOracle` - (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) the price cannot be updated by the contract owner.

This issue **SHOWS** that safety measures inside Centralized Oracle are **FAULTY**, the admins are trusted and the intention is to update  the price regularly, but the safety measures should work in case of unforeseen situations. This report shows that the safety checks taken are NOT enough and can insted harm the protocol.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There is listed enabled asset.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Price cannot be updated for 7 days
2. Token price is volatile as usual

### Attack Path

1. PIN price is updated to 0.8 USDC
2. The price is not updated during 6 days and it drops to 0.15 USDC
3. Because the price was not updated for so long there is big diffrence between actual price and price returned by oracle
4. User purchases assets from listing paying less because the PIN token is overvalued
5. More than 1 days passes by and protocol decides to update stale price seeing big diffrence between actual and price stored in the contract.
6. The Oracle contract prevents from updating the token price because of internal check even though it is actual price (0.15 * 5 < 0.8)
7. The price stays stale

### Impact

Users due to the fact that the STALENESS_THRESHOLD is so big, are at the risk that they will receive less for their listing/pay more for their purchases.
Because the STALENSS_THRESHOLD is so big, it is very reasonable to say that during 7 days price can drop more than 80% and in that scenario the price cannot be updated, leading to DOS of all purchase functions.

### Mitigation

Change the STALENESS_THRESHOLD to smaller amount and change the checks inside `updateTokenPrice` function.
