# Buyers are not properly protected during high volatility periods

### Summary

Listings have the particularity that their price is estimated in USD. When a transaction is executed, an oracle determines the equivalent amount in PIN Token to be accepted as payment. Due to this, even though users have slippage protection in `PinlinkShop::purchase`, this **can become counterproductive during periods of high volatility**.

The issue arises from a combination of factors:

* The price of listings is set in USD.
* Users pay the equivalent in PIN Token.
* Slippage is defined in PIN Token amount.

As a result, during periods of high market volatility—combined with the fact that the application plans to support Ethereum Mainnet—an attacker can monitor purchases and, during high volatility moments, call `PinlinkShop::modifyListing` to significantly increase the USD price. **This forces buyers to spend much more than they originally intended.**

This is possible because **modifying a listing does not change its ID** and **does not offer any protection for buyers.**

### Internal Pre-conditions

* A user is purchasing a listing from an attacker.
* The oracle (either the current one or a more advanced future version) reports a price change.

### External Pre-conditions

* High market volatility (PIN Token price increases significantly).

### Attack Path

Example scenario with the following initial conditions:

1 PIN Token = 1 USD

1. The attacker creates a listing for a share at $10 and waits.
2. Since prices are expressed in USD, a user decides to buy the listing for $10. The frontend calls `purchase` with `maxTotalPinAmount` close to 10 tokens.
3. At the same time, a high volatility event occurs (PIN Token price doubles).
4. The attacker, monitoring the mempool, takes advantage of the volatility spike and calls `modifyListing`, doubling the listing price.
5. The user's purchase goes through. Even though the user was only willing to spend up to $10, they end up paying $20.

### Impact

Users can suffer frontrunning attacks during high volatility periods, where the listing price increases, and since the listing retains the same ID and no parameter protects the buyer, they end up losing more money than expected.

Attackers are incentivized to extract as much value as possible, unfairly harming users attempting to make purchases in the marketplace.

### Mitigation

Slippage could be represented in USD or a secondary slippage parameter (slippage2) could be added, as USD is a more stable currency.
