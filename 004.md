# IPinToken.sol interface exposes mutable token configuration functions without constraint context

### Summary

The IPinToken interface (Lines 7–10) https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/interfaces/IPinToken.sol#L7-L10

 extends `IERC20` and adds two administrative mutation functions — `setExcludedFromFee()` and `setMaxWalletRatio()` — without any documentation, modifier expectations, or usage constraints. This could introduce confusion or unsafe implementation if used in external integrations or misunderstood by downstream contracts relying on this interface.

While this interface alone is not vulnerable, it provides administrative power that, if implemented improperly in a token contract, could lead to fee evasion or abuse of max wallet logic. 


### Root Cause

 • Lines 7–10: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/interfaces/IPinToken.sol#L7-L10


Interface includes the following functions:

`function setExcludedFromFee(address account, bool isExcluded) external;`
`function setMaxWalletRatio(uint32 maxWalletRatio) external;`

These functions are not accompanied by any context or expected access control assumptions, and there’s no indication whether these are owner-only, role-restricted, or callable by anyone.



### Internal Pre-conditions

 1. A contract uses IPinToken assuming it’s a safe abstraction layer.
 2. The actual token contract implements weak or missing access control on these functions.



### External Pre-conditions

 1. The interface is reused in another system where token configuration is assumed to be immutable.
 2. Integrators trust the interface without checking implementation-side access protection.



### Attack Path

(Not an exploit path in the interface alone, but a design trap.)
 1. A new contract integrates IPinToken and allows an external address to call these functions.
 2. Attacker manipulates fee exclusions or max wallet ratio by calling `setExcludedFromFee()` or `setMaxWalletRatio()` if implemented insecurely downstream.
 3. Fee logic or tokenomics gets bypassed, degrading protocol fairness or behavior.


### Impact

 • Integrator assumptions may be violated.
 • Fee mechanics could be bypassed if used insecurely.
 • Max wallet limits might be manipulated maliciously in poorly implemented systems.



### PoC


IPinToken token = IPinToken(tokenAddress);
token.setMaxWalletRatio(1000000); // arbitrarily large value, bypassing limits
token.setExcludedFromFee(attackerEOA, true); // attacker avoids token fees

### Mitigation

 • Clearly document expected access control in the interface definition or comments.
 • Recommend using onlyOwner or AccessControl modifiers in implementing contracts.
 • Optionally split IPinToken into read-only and admin interfaces for safer integration practices.
