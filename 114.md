# Owner-Controlled Price Updates with Wide 5x Threshold

### Summary

The CentralizedOracle contract's design choice to allow a 5x price deviation threshold will cause market manipulation for PinlinkShop users as a malicious/compromised owner can arbitrarily inflate or deflate the token price within this range.

### Root Cause

In CentralizedOracle.sol:38-41, the updateTokenPrice function restricts price updates to a ±5x range of the current price. This allows the owner to manipulate prices by up to 500% in either direction, violating the protocol’s intended price stability.

### Internal Pre-conditions

    Admin Action: The owner must call updateTokenPrice() to adjust the price within the 5x range.

    Token State: The current price (_tokenPriceInUsd) must be non-zero and within the 5x threshold of the proposed new price.

### External Pre-conditions

    Market Volatility: The real-world price of the token must not deviate by more than 5x from the oracle’s last-reported price (unlikely in most scenarios, making this a deliberate attack).

### Attack Path

.

### Impact

    Affected Party: Buyers and sellers in PinlinkShop.

    Loss: Users suffer losses equivalent to up to 80% of their expected token value (e.g., buying 1 PIN at 5insteadof5insteadof1).

    Attacker Gain: A malicious owner could front-run purchases or listings to extract value from users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

    Narrow Threshold: Reduce the maximum deviation (e.g., ±20%).

    Decentralize Governance: Replace owner control with a multi-sig or on-chain governance.
