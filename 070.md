# Users will lose unclaimed rewards when rewards are updated

### Summary

The StreamHandler library contains a vulnerability where users lose their accrued rewards when admin deposits new rewards if they haven't triggered the updateRewards() function during the previous reward period.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability exists because the contract tracks only one global reward period (lastDepositTimestamp and drippingPeriod). When a new reward deposit occurs, these values are overwritten, causing old rewards to be lost. Specifically:

Overwriting Critical State in `depositRewards`:

```solidity
self.lastDepositTimestamp = block.timestamp; // <--- Resets timestamp for ALL rewards
self.drippingPeriod = drippingPeriod;         // <--- Overrides previous period
```

This resets the timestamp and dripping period globally, removing any previous reward distribution.

Here is how rewards are caclulated:
```solidity
    function updateRewards(RewardsStream storage self, address account) internal {
        uint256 globalPerStaked = self.globalRewardsPerStaked();
        self.pendingRewards[account] += self._pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate(globalPerStaked, account);
        self.updatedRewardsPerStaked[account] = globalPerStaked;
    }
```
```solidity
function globalRewardsPerStaked(RewardsStream storage self) internal view returns (uint256) {
        if (self.lastDepositTimestamp == 0) return 0;

        // safe subtraction as is always less or equal to block.timestamp
@>   uint256 timeSinceDeposit = block.timestamp - self.lastDepositTimestamp;

        uint256 _drippingDuration = self.drippingPeriod;
        // if the _drippingDuration has passed, then locked is 0
        // at deposit, locked has to be deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked
        // during the _drippingDuration, locked is an interpolation between deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked and 0
        uint256 locked = (timeSinceDeposit > _drippingDuration)
            ? 0
            : self.deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked * (_drippingDuration - (timeSinceDeposit)) / _drippingDuration;

        /// return the target after _drippingDuration, and before that, an interpolation between last and new target
        return self.globalRewardsPerStakedTarget - locked;
    }
```



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There must be some staked shares
2. There must be one reward period that was over
3. The admin has to start new reward period for the same 

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User has some staked assets in the shop
2. Admin sets rewards for his assets
3. The rewards period passes
4. The admin sets new rewards for the same assets
5. The user tries to claim his rewards (he will lose his rewards from last period)

### Impact

Users will lose their rewards from previous periods
