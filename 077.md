# Users wont be able to any assets deposit

### Summary

On `_deposit`, the contract tries to "transfer" deposited amount from `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` to the user. This fails, because `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` doesnt have any `stakedBalances` and will revert every time. 

### Root Cause

Each time user tries to deposit assets, the contract calls this internal fn:

```solidity
    function _deposit(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) internal {
        // it is only possible to deposit in already enabled assets in the ecosystem
        if (!streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].isEnabled()) revert AssetNotEnabled();

        // When assets are withdrawn, the rewards are directed to the feeReceiver.
        // When they are deposited back, they are redirected to the staker who deposits
@>  streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, msg.sender, amount);

        emit FractionsDeposited(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, msg.sender);
        IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId, amount, "");
    }
```

As it can be observed, it tries to transfer balance from `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` to the user. This is wrong and should be the other way around. Because of this mistake, contract will revert with underflow error:
```solidity
    function transferBalances(RewardsStream storage self, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        self.updateRewards(from);
        self.updateRewards(to);
@>  self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount; // this will revert since the proxy account doesnt have anything
        self.stakedBalances[to] += amount;
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The asset that the user tries to deposit is enabled

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

User tries to deposit assets with some of the deposit fns.

### Impact

Because users wont be able to deposit any assets, half of the contract becomes useless.
