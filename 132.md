# _deposit function doesn't account for 0 amounts

### Summary

The `_deposit` function, used for `depositAndList` and `depositAsset` isn't performing any 0 amount checks and proceeds to make cross-function and external calls using arbitrary amounts.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L522 there are no arbitrary amount checks

### Internal Pre-conditions

.

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

1. User deposits arbitrary amounts, creating listings for assets that have no value due to 0 amount
2. Delisting needs to be performed manually

### Impact

Redundant gas usage, protocol congestion, affected user experience

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Perform 0-amount checks
