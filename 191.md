# ## [M-1] Attacker can Farm rewards by entering the system strategically


**Description** 
An attacker can exploit the reward distribution mechanism by entering the system after the reward dripping period begins, allowing them to accumulate unfair rewards compared to early participants. The attacker can repeatedly purchase and sell shares, compounding their rewards unfairly.

**Vulnerability:** Late entry into the system allows an attacker to acquire rewards unfairly by buying shares after the dripping period starts.
Allows late buying

No locking periods for new buyers

**Impact:**
  - Legitimate users who buy shares at the start get diluted rewards.
  - Attackers can accumulate more rewards unfairly by strategically entering and exiting multiple times.
**Assumptions:**
  1. Assets are available to buy when the dripping period starts.
  2. Rewards are distributed sometime after listing.

**Mitigation:**

1. **Implement a Lock-in Period**
   - Require users to hold assets for a minimum period before they can claim rewards.
2. **Pause Asset Purchases During Dripping Period**
   - Restrict users from buying shares once the reward dripping period starts.
   - Prevents new entrants from taking advantage of ongoing distributions.
