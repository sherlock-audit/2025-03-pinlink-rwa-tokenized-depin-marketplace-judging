# assetSupply = 1e4 will revert, but it should be allowed according to code.

### Summary

The [enableAsset()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L64-L72) function is responsible for initializing a fractionalized asset for trading. It takes three parameters:

`self`: A reference to the RewardsStream storage structure.

`assetSupply`: The total number of fractional tokens minted for the asset.

`receiver`: The address that will initially hold the tokens (will initially be admin).

The function includes two require statements to validate the assetSupply:

```solidity
require(assetSupply > 0, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyIsZero()); ensures that assetSupply is greater than zero.

require(assetSupply < MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh()); 
//ensures that assetSupply is less than the maximum allowed value (MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY), which is defined as 1e4 (10,000).
```

### Root Cause

The issue arises in the second require statement. The condition` assetSupply < MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY` rejects any assetSupply value that is equal to or greater than [MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L47). 

This means that when `assetSupply is exactly 10,000`, the function will revert with the error PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh(), even though 10,000 is the intended maximum value.

The correct operator should be <= (less than or equal to), which would include the upper bound as a valid value.

### Internal Pre-conditions

NA

### External Pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

The call will fail with revert for an assetSupply that is to be accepted/enabled, and included in the market place.

### Impact

The current implementation prevents the enabling of assets with an `assetSupply` of exactly 10,000, even though this value is intended to be valid. This limitation could disrupt the functionality of the marketplace, as assets with the maximum allowed supply cannot be initialized for trading.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
function enableAsset(RewardsStream storage self, uint256 assetSupply, address receiver) internal {
    require(assetSupply > 0, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyIsZero());
>   require(assetSupply <= MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh());
    self.updateRewards(receiver);
    self.stakedBalances[receiver] += assetSupply;
    self.assetSupply = assetSupply;
}
```
