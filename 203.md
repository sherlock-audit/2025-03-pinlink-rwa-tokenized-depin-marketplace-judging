# Front-running CentralizedOracle::updateTokenPrice leads to an adversary purchasing fractional assets at lower price.

### Summary

The lack of real-time price updates in`CentralizedOracle` contract creates opportunity for adversaries to purchase listed fractional assets at lower price than expected. 

### Root Cause

The [CentralizedOracle::updateTokenPrice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/34cd70b66f1dbe191bd6f946e42f58eef4a00166/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L52C1-L68C6) function is as follows:
```solidity
    /// @notice Update the price of TOKEN in USD terms
    /// @dev The price should be expressed with 18 decimals.
    /// @dev Example. To set the TOKEN price to 0.88 USD, the input should be 880000000000000000
    function updateTokenPrice(uint256 usdPerToken) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 _currentPrice = _tokenPriceInUsd;

        // sanity checks to avoid too large deviations caused by bot/human errors
        if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
        if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();

        _tokenPriceInUsd = usdPerToken;
        lastPriceUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        // todo potential improvement. Everytime we update, we crosscheck the price with the Uniswap spot price
        //  - centralized, but controlled by a decentralized oracle, so that we can't manipulate it
        //  - cheaper to run than a TWAP oracle
        //  - less manipulable (except by us)

        emit PriceUpdated(usdPerToken);
    }
```
Stale price tolerance threshold is below:
```solidity
/// @notice The maximum time that can pass since the last price update
uint256 public constant STALENESS_THRESHOLD = 7 days;
```

Notice PIN token price is only updated by the oracle owner and the price will only be considered as stale if it isn't updated within 7 days. But [here](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pinlink) we can see the price of PIN token is very volatile, it fluctuates a lot in every hour. If the PIN price drops from $1 to $0.5 within an hour and the oracle hasn't been updates yet by the owner this creates opportunity for an adversary to buy all listed fractional assets at half market price. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There should be some fractional assets listed for sale. 
2. Oracle price not being updated with the latest price. 

### External Pre-conditions

1. PIN token price should drop by a certain percentage that would benefit the adversary to run a front-running attack.

### Attack Path

1. Current PIN token price in the oracle is $1. 
2. 100 fractional assets are listed for sale at $10 per asset price. So total price in PIN is 1000.
3. Suddenly PIN price drops 50% in the open market. It's current market price is $0.5. 
4. Noticing the sudden price drops the oracle owner sends a transaction by calling `CentralizedOracle::updateTokenPrice` function to correct oracle price. 
5. An adversary notices the price drops too. He buys 1000 PIN with $500 from the open market and sends a transaction by calling `PinlinkShop::purchase` function to purchase all 100 fractional assets with higher gas price. 

### Impact

1. Sellers get less payment.
2. Platform get less fee.

### Mitigation

Use TWAP price oracle.
