# Users cant purchase assets if the admin sets fee to 0.

### Summary

When users purchase assets vis purchase() they pay in PIN token and a fee is taken from it. If the fee is non-zero, the seller would get the (sale amount - fee) and the `feeReceiver` would get the fee. When the fee is 0 the seller would get the full amount and the `feeReceiver` would get 0. But the PIN token reverts on 0 transfers and purchase() would revert if the fee is set to 0. 

### Root Cause

The function [purchase()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts%2Fsrc%2Fmarketplaces%2FpinlinkShop.sol#L288-L322) calls _handlePayments() to send the sale amount to seller and fees to feeReceiver.
```solidity
    function purchase(bytes32 listingId, uint256 fractionsAmount, uint256 maxTotalPinAmount) external {
        require(fractionsAmount > 0, ExpectedNonZero());

        Listing storage listing = _listings[listingId];

        address seller = listing.seller;
        uint256 tokenId = listing.tokenId;
        address fractionalAssets = listing.fractionalAssets;

        // make InvalidListingId be the one that fails first
        require(seller != address(0), InvalidListingId());
        // purchases on the exact deadline not allowed
        require(block.timestamp < listing.deadline, ListingDeadlineExpired());

        {
            // to prevent stack too deep
            uint256 listedAmount = listing.amount;
            if (listedAmount < fractionsAmount) revert NotEnoughTokens();
            // update listing information in storage
            listing.amount = listedAmount - fractionsAmount;
            _listedBalances[fractionalAssets][tokenId][seller] -= fractionsAmount;

            streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(seller, msg.sender, fractionsAmount);
        }

        uint256 totalUsdPayment = listing.usdPricePerFraction * fractionsAmount;
        uint256 totalPinPayment = IPinlinkOracle(oracle).convertFromUsd(address(PIN), totalUsdPayment);

        if (totalPinPayment == 0) revert StaleOraclePrice();
        if (totalPinPayment > maxTotalPinAmount) revert SlippageExceeded();

        // transfers the payment to the seller and the fees to the feeReceiver
        // note: ERC20 with callbacks (ERC777) are not supported, so the following should be safe
@>      (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees) = _handlePayments(msg.sender, seller, totalPinPayment);

```
[handlePayments()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts%2Fsrc%2Fmarketplaces%2FpinlinkShop.sol#L534) calculate the fee to send to the feeReceiver and the rest is sent to the seller. 
```solidity
    function _handlePayments(address buyer, address seller, uint256 totalPinPayment)
        internal
        returns (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees)
    {
        // fees are rounded in favor of the protocol
        paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
        fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;

        // no need to verfy that msg.value==0, because purchases with tokens are done with purchaseWithToken() which is non-payable
        IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, paymentForSeller);
@>      IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, feeReceiver, fees);
    }
```
However, if the `purchaseFeePerc` is 0, this would transfer 0 amount of PIN tokens to the feeReceiver and the purchase() call would revert as the PIN token doesnt allow 0 transfers. [PIN:_transfer()](https://etherscan.io/address/0x2e44f3f609ff5aA4819B323FD74690f07C3607c4)

```solidity
    function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) private {
        require(from != address(0), "ERC20: transfer from the zero address");
        require(to != address(0), "ERC20: transfer to the zero address");
@>      require(amount > 0, "Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
...
        
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin needs to set fee to 0.

### External Pre-conditions

There needs to be a listing and user must purchase.

### Attack Path

none.

### Impact

Users cant purchase tokens if the fee is 0.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Dont allow the admin to set fee to 0.
