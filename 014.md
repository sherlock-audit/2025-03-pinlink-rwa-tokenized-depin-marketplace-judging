# Missing interface support detection for IERC7572 in supportsInterface method

## Description:
The `FractionalAssets` contract declares that it implements the IERC7572 interface, but the `supportsInterface()` function  does not check for this interface's identifier, violating the requirements of the ERC-165 standard.
Current implementation:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/fractional/FractionalAssets.sol#L50
```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
    public
    view
    virtual
    override(AccessControl, ERC1155)
    returns (bool)
{
    return AccessControl.supportsInterface(interfaceId) || ERC1155.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
}
```

## Impact:
According to the [official ERC-165 documentation](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165), a contract must correctly report all supported interfaces. The absence of a check for IERC7572 will cause external contracts checking for support of this interface to receive an incorrect result (`false`), even though the contract claims to implement it.

IERC7572 interface provides an important external function `contractURI()`, which is used by marketplaces and other external systems to retrieve contract metadata. The absence of a check for this interface in supportsInterface will lead to the following issues:

- Other smart contracts that rely on ERC165 to programmatically detect supported interfaces will fail to recognize the `contractURI()` functionality, potentially causing integration failures.
- Systems that dynamically determine how to interact with the contract based on its supported interfaces will lack complete information, limiting proper interaction patterns

## Recommended Mitigation:
Add a check for the IERC7572 interface in the `supportsInterface()` function
