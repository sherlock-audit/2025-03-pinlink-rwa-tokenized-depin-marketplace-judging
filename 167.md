# Centralized Oracle updates can be front run causing users to get paid less than intended

### Summary

PinLink uses `CentralizedOracle` to read and update USD price of PIN token, later RWA sales happen using PIN tokens, this creates an opportunity for users buying RWAs to front run price updates to buy cheaper than seller's intended price.

### Root Cause

The choice to use an oracle contract and trying to read on chain data to update that oracle contract is a mistake as that contract's updates can be front run, making oracle data stale.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

From the README, price updates happen like so:
>The bot will only check every X minutes if price needs to be updated (X to be defined)
The bot only updates the price if it differs from the current oracle price in more than Y% (to be defined)

Prices changing within X minutes and price differs Y%, i.e. up to and including bot is triggered to submit an update

### Attack Path

1. Pin price drops Y%, `CentralizedOracle` update is submitted by the bot
2. Bot gets front run by Alice to buy one fraction that was priced at 10 PIN, PIN being 1$, Alice will pay 10$ - 10$ * Y%

### Impact

Attacker has the ability to buy listed assets Y% cheaper, seller of the assets will be forced to sell Y% cheaper.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using a more robust pattern to fetch price data.
