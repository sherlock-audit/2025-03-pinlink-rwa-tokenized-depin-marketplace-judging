# Initial Price Check and Update Limitation

## Description
The CentralizedOracle contract includes a check in the constructor to ensure that the initial price of the token is not less than 1e6. This check is intended to prevent setting an initial price that is too low. However, this logic has a limitation where it would take 18 updates to increase the price from 1e6 to 1e18, with each update being limited to a 5x increase.

## Impact
Slow Price Adjustment: The limitation on the maximum price increase per update (5x) means that it would take multiple updates to significantly increase the price. This can be problematic in volatile markets where rapid price adjustments are necessary.
Operational Overhead: The need for multiple updates to reach a desired price level increases the operational overhead for the owner or the entity responsible for updating the price.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L39

Set Initial Price: Deploy the CentralizedOracle contract with an initial price of 1e6.
Attempt to Increase Price: Call the updateTokenPrice function to increase the price to 1e18.
Observe Limitation: Notice that it requires 18 updates to reach the desired price, with each update being limited to a 5x increase.

## Exploit Scenario
The contract is deployed with an initial price of 1e6.
The market price of the token increases rapidly, requiring the oracle to update the price to 1e18.
Due to the 5x increase limitation, the owner has to perform 18 separate updates to reach the desired price, causing delays and potential discrepancies in the price feed.

##Mitigation
Adjust Update Logic: Modify the update logic to allow for larger price adjustments in a single update, while still maintaining sanity checks to prevent extreme deviations.
Use Off-Chain Data: Incorporate off-chain signed data from trusted oracles to validate and update the price, ensuring that the price adjustments are accurate and timely.
Code Example for Mitigation
Adjust Update Logic
```solidity
// ...existing code...

constructor(address token_, uint256 initialPriceInUsd_) Ownable(msg.sender) {
    TOKEN = token_;

    // Adjust the initial price check to allow for a wider range of valid prices
    if (initialPriceInUsd_ < 1e3) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__InvalidPrice();

    _tokenPriceInUsd = initialPriceInUsd_;
    lastPriceUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

    emit PriceUpdated(initialPriceInUsd_);
}

function updateTokenPrice(uint256 usdPerToken) external onlyOwner {
    uint256 _currentPrice = _tokenPriceInUsd;

    // Adjust the sanity checks to allow for larger price adjustments
    if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 10) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
    if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 10) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();

    _tokenPriceInUsd = usdPerToken;
    lastPriceUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

    emit PriceUpdated(usdPerToken);
}

// ...existing code...
```
By implementing these mitigations, the contract can handle rapid price adjustments more effectively, reducing the operational overhead and ensuring timely updates in volatile markets.
