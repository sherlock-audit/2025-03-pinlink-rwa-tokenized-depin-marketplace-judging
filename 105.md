# Excessive oracle freshness interval (7 Days) leads to stale prices

# Summary

The protocolâ€™s oracle freshness window is set to 7 days, which is significantly longer than industry best practices. This configuration allows outdated prices to be used, increasing the risk of inaccurate valuations, especially in volatile markets.

# Description

In the `CentralizedOracle::convertToUsd` function, the oracle freshness check considers prices valid for up to 7 days. This means that even if the last update occurred days ago, the price is still accepted. While the owner is trusted, there is no enforcement of frequent updates, which could result in outdated pricing. Best practices suggest following real-time or dynamically triggered updates like those used by Chainlink oracles.

```solidity
function convertToUsd(address token, uint256 tokenAmountIn) external view returns (uint256 usdAmount) {
        if (token != TOKEN) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__InvalidToken();
        if (tokenAmountIn == 0) return 0;

@>  if ((block.timestamp - lastPriceUpdateTimestamp) > STALENESS_THRESHOLD) { // @audit-issue
            return 0;
        }

        // it is accepted that this conversion is rounded down for the purpose of this MVP
        // TOKEN[18] * price[USD/TOKEN][18] / PIN_DECIMALS[18] = USD[18]
        return (tokenAmountIn * _tokenPriceInUsd) / SCALE;
    }
```

# Impact
- Outdated price feeds may lead to incorrect valuations.
- Potential manipulation risks due to infrequent updates.

# Recommendation

If the protocol does not plan to integrate a TWAP oracle or Chainlink Price Feeds in the short term, consider using Chainlink Functions to enable dynamic, event-driven price updates and improve pricing accuracy.
