# Changing Fee Will Affect Live Listings, Causing Sellers Receive Less Tokens Than Expected

### Summary

The `PinlinkShop::setFee` function allows the admin to change the `purchaseFeePerc` at any time. This fee is applied at the time of purchase, not when a listing is created. As a result, sellers who create listings expecting a certain fee percentage may end up receiving less than anticipated if the fee is increased before their listings are purchased.

This creates a poor user experience and potential financial loss for sellers, as they have no way to know what fee will actually be applied when their listings are eventually purchased.

### Root Cause

[`PinlinkShop::setFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L174) updates the fees for all listings, including yet to be created and already existing ones.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There should be existing listings;
2. Protocol needs to update the `purchaseFeePerc` via `PinlinkShop::setFee`.


### External Pre-conditions



### Attack Path

1. Alice lists 10 fractions of Asset #42 at 100 USD per fraction when `purchaseFeePerc` is 100 (1%)
2. Alice expects to receive 99 USD worth of PIN tokens per fraction after the 1% fee
3. Admin calls `PinlinkShop::setFee(500)` to increase the fee to 5%
4. Bob purchases 1 fraction from Alice's listing
5. Instead of receiving 99 USD worth of PIN tokens, Alice only receives 95 USD worth
6. Alice has lost 4 USD worth of PIN tokens due to the fee increase that occurred after her listing was created

### Impact

Undesired/Unexpected loss for the seller, bad user experience.

### PoC



### Mitigation

Store a current fee percentage in the listing and use the stored fee percentage in purchases.
