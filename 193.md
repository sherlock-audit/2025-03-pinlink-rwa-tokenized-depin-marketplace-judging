# Seller can Front-Run or set high value to Brick Purchases via Overflow

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L269-L311

Sellers can set `usdPricePerFraction` to 2^256-1, causing overflows in purchase(), or frontrun a `startPurchase` transaction call with `modifyListing` to force a revert due to not enough amount.

### Root Cause

- Missing upper bound check for usdPricePerFraction during listing.
- Missing time buffer between creation of listing and modifying listings

### Internal Pre-conditions

Seller has listed an asset.

### External Pre-conditions

Buyer attempts to purchase.

### Attack Path

- Seller lists asset at usdPricePerFraction = 1e18.
- Buyer approves 1e18
- Buyer sends purchase tx.
- Seller front-runs with `modifyListing(2^256-1)` or `modifyListing(10e18)`
- Buyer’s tx computes totalUsdPayment = 2^256-1 * fractionAmount → reverts due to overflow. OR 
- Buyer’s tx computes totalUsdPayment = 2oe18 * fractionAmount → reverts due to not enough allowance. or slippage exceeded
- 

### Impact

Permanent/Temporary denial-of-service for all purchases of a listing.

### PoC

seller.list(fractionalAssets, tokenId, 1e18, 1e18, deadline); // Legit listing
buyer.startPurchase(listingId, 1e18);
seller.modifyListing(listingId, type(uint256).max, 0); // Set max price
// purchase() reverts: "Arithmetic over/underflow"

### Mitigation

Enforce `usdPricePerFraction` <= MAX_USD_PRICE and add time buffer between price changes
