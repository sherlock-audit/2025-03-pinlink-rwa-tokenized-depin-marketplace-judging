# Due to incorrect fee payment, users can purchase tokens without paying fees

### Summary

In the pinlinkShop contract, user can purchase listed tokens using the `purchase()` function. The total price of the token a user wants to buy is calculated through the `convertFromUsd()` function of IPinlinkOracle, and this value is stored in `totalPinPayment`. The `totalPinPayment` value is still the price without fees included. Fee calculation takes place inside the `_handlePayments()` function

> The purchaseFeePerc is the fee taken on every purchase in PIN tokens. This value can be updated by DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, but cannot exceed 10%.

I'll explain part of the document here. The document specifies that users must pay a fee when making a purchase. It states that this fee has a maximum of 10%. In other words, when users make a purchase, they should pay the `total price of the token` + `the fee`

The `_handlePayments()` function calculates the amount to be transferred to the Seller and the amount to be transferred to the feeReceiver based on the fee, and then proceeds with the final settlement. Here, the `total price of the token` and the `fee` should be paid to the seller and the fee receiver, but it's transferring the `total price of the token - fee` and `the fee`

This means that from the user's perspective, it's the same as paying the original amount that should be paid, not paying a fee. Due to incorrect calculation, all users end up not paying fees.

```text
>>> FEE_DENOMINATOR = 10000
>>> purchaseFeePerc = 500
>>> principal = 10000
>>> paymentForSeller = principal * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR
>>> fees = principal - paymentForSeller
>>> paymentForSeller + fees == principal
True
```
The above is an example.

### Root Cause

```solidity
    function _handlePayments(address buyer, address seller, uint256 totalPinPayment)
        internal
        returns (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees)
    {

        paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR; // <- here
        fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;

        // no need to verfy that msg.value==0, because purchases with tokens are done with purchaseWithToken() which is non-payable
        IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, paymentForSeller);  // <- here
        IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, feeReceiver, fees);
    }
// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L534
```
As explained above, in the `_handlePayments()` function, fees are calculated and settled to the seller and fee receiver. However, if you look at the amount transferred to the seller, the amount transferred is the amount that the user should pay when purchasing minus the fee. As a result, the buyer does not pay a fee on the token price. All users who make purchases are buying without paying fees.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The listed token must exist
2. The purchase time of the listed token must not have passed

### External Pre-conditions

1. Users need PIN tokens to purchase tokens

### Attack Path

1. Call the purchase() function to purchase the listed tokens
2. Verify that no additional fees are incurred on the total token price by printing console.log() logs

### Impact

1. All users won't pay additional fees on the total token price
2. Sellers are not guaranteed the original cost of their token
3. Sellers participating in the protocol lose trust in this protocol

The above PoC proves that the user did not actually pay additional fees after purchasing tokens from listingId2

In the results of running the PoC, it is proven that no fees were paid because the amount paid to the seller plus the fee equals the original price of the token



### Mitigation

```diff
    function _handlePayments(address buyer, address seller, uint256 totalPinPayment)
        internal
        returns (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees)
    {

        paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR; // <- here
        fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;

        // no need to verfy that msg.value==0, because purchases with tokens are done with purchaseWithToken() which is non-payable
-       IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, paymentForSeller); 
+       IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, totalPinPayment); 
        IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, feeReceiver, fees);
    }
```
If patched as above, users will pay the original cost + fee, and the original cost and fee are guaranteed
