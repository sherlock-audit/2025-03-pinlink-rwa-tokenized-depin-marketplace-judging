# The function `depositAsset` and `withdrawAsset` allow users to trade without trading fee.

### Summary

The function `depositAsset` and `withdrawAsset` allow users to trade without trading fee.
So there is no need to list and purchase from lists.

### Root Cause

The ability for one user to withdraw fractional assets while another user simultaneously deposits the same assets effectively creates a scenario where they can trade without incurring any fees. Hereâ€™s how this mechanism works:

1.Withdrawals: When a user withdraws their assets from the marketplace, they are not charged a fee. This allows them to take their assets out of the platform without any cost.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L352-L360
```solidity
    function withdrawAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, address receiver) external {
        if (_nonListedBalance(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender) < amount) revert NotEnoughUnlistedTokens();

        // this does't transfer the assets, but only the internal accounting of staking balances
@>      streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(msg.sender, REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, amount);

        emit FractionsWithdrawn(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, receiver);
@>      IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(address(this), receiver, tokenId, amount, "");
    }

    /// @notice deposit an enabled asset into the ecosystem
    /// @dev the assets are automatically staked as they enter in the ecosystem
    function depositAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external {
        _deposit(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount);
    }
```
2.Deposits: Similarly, when another user deposits assets into the marketplace, there is no fee applied to this action either.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L522-L532
```solidity
    function _deposit(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) internal {
        // it is only possible to deposit in already enabled assets in the ecosystem
        if (!streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].isEnabled()) revert AssetNotEnabled();

        // When assets are withdrawn, the rewards are directed to the feeReceiver.
        // When they are deposited back, they are redirected to the staker who deposits
@>      streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, msg.sender, amount);

        emit FractionsDeposited(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, msg.sender);
@>      IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId, amount, "");
    }
```
3.Simultaneous Actions: If User A withdraws their assets and User B deposits the same amount of those assets, it effectively constitutes a trade between the two users without any fees being incurred.
As a result, there is no need to list and purchase.
However, trading with the `purchase` function requires `paymentForSeller` to be processed in the `paymentForSeller` function for PIN token.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L288-L325
```solidity
function purchase(bytes32 listingId, uint256 fractionsAmount, uint256 maxTotalPinAmount) external {
        [...]
@>        (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees) = _handlePayments(msg.sender, seller, totalPinPayment);

        // buyer receives purchased tokens at the very end (IFractionalAssets.onReceived callback is the most dangerous external call)
        emit Purchased(listingId, msg.sender, seller, fractionsAmount, paymentForSeller, fees, totalUsdPayment);
    }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L288-L325
```solidity
    function _handlePayments(address buyer, address seller, uint256 totalPinPayment)
        internal
        returns (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees)
    {
        // fees are rounded in favor of the protocol
        paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
        fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;

        // no need to verfy that msg.value==0, because purchases with tokens are done with purchaseWithToken() which is non-payable
@>   IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, paymentForSeller);
@>   IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, feeReceiver, fees);
    }
```
Therefore, users prefer to use `deposit` and `withdraw` functions because trading through the PIN linked Shop incurs fees.

### Attack Path
-Using `withdrawAsset` and `depositAsset`
1.User A calls `withdrawAsset()` to withdraw their `x` fractional assets with `tokenId = y`.
2.User B calls `depositAsset()` to deposit their `x` fractional assets with `tokenId = y`.
3.User B calls `withdrawAsset()` to withdraw their `x` fractional assets with `tokenId = y`.
4.User A calls `depositAsset()` to deposit their `x` fractional assets with `tokenId = y`.

Total Cost: There is no cost incurred in this process.

-Using PIN Linked Shop
1.User B calls purchase() to buy x fractional assets with `tokenId = y` from the list.
2.User A calls purchase() to buy x fractional assets with `tokenId = y` from the list.

Total Impact: There is no change in `self.stakedBalances[A]`, `self.stakedBalances[B]`, or the balances of fractional assets with `tokenId = y` for Users A and B. However, the PIN balance decreased.

### Impact

-Increased Trading Activity: Users can freely move their assets in and out of the marketplace without worrying about additional costs, potentially leading to increased trading activity and liquidity.

-Bypassing Purchase Fees: Users could theoretically trade assets between themselves by depositing into the marketplace and then withdrawing, effectively bypassing the purchase fee mechanism. This could undermine the intended fee structure of the marketplace.

-Market Manipulation Risks: The ability to trade without fees could lead to market manipulation. For example, users might create listings at artificially low prices, withdraw assets, and then deposit them again, effectively avoiding fees while manipulating the market.

-Revenue Loss for the Platform: If users consistently bypass the fee structure, the platform may face significant revenue losses, affecting its sustainability and ability to maintain operations.

-Devaluation of Assets: If trading becomes too easy without fees, it could lead to devaluation of the fractional assets as market dynamics shift, affecting both sellers and buyers.

### Mitigation

Please add a logic to prevent free fee trading.
For example, implement fees on withdrawals and deposits.
