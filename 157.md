# USDC Blacklisted Users Need Alternative Reward Redemption Path

## Finding description and impact

In the PinlinkShop contract, when a user becomes blacklisted, any rewards allocated to them become permanently locked in the contract with no recovery mechanism. This vulnerability affects both claimRewards() and claimRewardsMultiple() functions.

## Proof of Concept

The PinlinkShop contract distributes USDC rewards to users who own fractions of tokenized real-world assets. However, USDC implements a blacklist mechanism that allows its issuers to prevent specific addresses from sending or receiving tokens. When a blacklisted user attempts to claim their rewards, the entire transaction will revert due to the USDC transfer failure, it effectively prevents blacklisted users from accessing their legitimately earned rewards.

## Recommended mitigation steps

Add receiver parameter to `claimRewards` and `claimRewardsMultiple` functions so that blacklisted user can receive rewards in another address:

```solidity
 function claimRewards(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, address receiver) external {

    if (receiver == address(0)) revert();
    
    uint256 claimed = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].claimRewards(msg.sender);
    if (claimed == 0) return;
    
    IERC20(REWARDS_TOKEN).safeTransfer(receiver, claimed);
    emit Claimed(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, claimed, receiver);
}

function claimRewardsMultiple(address fractionalAssets, uint256[] calldata tokenIds, address receiver) external {
    if (receiver == address(0)) revert();
    
    uint256 totalClaimed;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < tokenIds.length; i++) {
        uint256 claimed = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenIds[i]].claimRewards(msg.sender);
        totalClaimed += claimed;
        emit Claimed(fractionalAssets, tokenIds[i], msg.sender, claimed, receiver);
    }
    
    if (totalClaimed > 0) {
        IERC20(REWARDS_TOKEN).safeTransfer(receiver, totalClaimed);
    }
}
```
