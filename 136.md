# Wrong value is transferred to seller during a purchase

### Summary

```solidity
paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
```

paymentForSeller looks like calculation for fees. 

### Root Cause

```solidity
paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
```

`paymentForSeller` which is calculation for fees is misnamed and sent to `seller` instead of `feeReceiver`
