# Users with blacklisted USDC addresses will lose rewards in PinlinkShop

### Summary

The PinlinkShop contract's lack of alternative reward claiming options will cause a permanent loss of earned rewards for users whose addresses are blacklisted by USDC, as they cannot redirect their rewards to non-blacklisted addresses.

### Root Cause

In `PinlinkShop.sol:328-334` and `PinlinkShop.sol:337-347`, the reward claiming functions transfer USDC exclusively to the caller's address (`msg.sender`), without providing an option for users to specify an alternative recipient.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The user has accumulated rewards in the PinlinkShop contract
2. The user's address becomes blacklisted by USDC

### External Pre-conditions

1. USDC issuer (Circle) has blacklisted the user's address

### Attack Path

This will outline the issue, not an attack.

1. A user contributes to the PinlinkShop platform and accumulates rewards
2. The user's address gets blacklisted by USDC for any reason
3. User attempts to call `claimRewards()` or `claimRewardsMultiple()`
4. The transaction reverts when executing `IERC20(REWARDS_TOKEN).safeTransfer(msg.sender, claimed)` because USDC transfers involving blacklisted addresses are blocked
5. The user has no alternative method to claim their accumulated rewards

### Impact

Users with blacklisted addresses cannot claim their earned rewards. This results in a permanent loss of all accumulated rewards for affected users, and these assets effectively become locked within the contract. While contract administrators can claim unassigned rewards to alternative addresses via `claimUnassignedRewards()`, regular users have no such option for their personal rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To address this vulnerability, implement an optional alternative recipient parameter in reward claiming functions.
