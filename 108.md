# USDC reward token is Upgradeable and may break contract logic and expected functionality

### Summary

The USDC token, which is used as the reward token in the contracts, is an upgradeable token that lies behind a Proxy. Token owners can, at any time, change token implementation, which can break contracts from expected past behaviour e.g turn into reentrant token, turn into fee on transfer token, turn into blacklisting, pausable, change decimals or some other weird features or unexpected behaviour.

### Root Cause

In pinlinkShop.sol#L150, the choice is made to exclusively use USDC as immutable unchangeable

This choice of a singular unchangeable token that is upgradeable will break the smart contract as detailed examples to follow will show e.g prevent claim rewards by users

### Internal Pre-conditions


1. USDC is the only reward token and set as immutable
2. All transfer aspects of USDC reward tokens in the protocol at risk of breaking if USDC is upgraded and modified in certain ways

### External Pre-conditions

USDC token on ethereum is upgradeable token behind proxy

### Attack Path

Pausable Example
1. USDC owners/admins/controllers upgrade USDC if not already Pausable to be Pausable
2. USDC is Paused
3. All transfers of USDC tokens revert

Blocklisting
1. USDC owners/admins/controllers upgrade USDC if not already Blacklisting to be Blacklisting
2. USDC Blacklists pinlinkShop and or admin, and or operator_role addresses
3. Contracts and the above addresses can't receive or transfer out tokens

Fee on Transfer 
1. USDC owners/admins/controllers upgrade USDC to be fee on transfer
2. Rewards claimed by users are less than expected depending how high fee is set

### Impact

1. Contract breaks as rewards cant be deposited into blacklisted contract
2. Contracts break as transfer rewards in or out are not plausible if USDC paused
3. Users get lower than expected rewards if USDC made a fee on the transfer
- where user in previous state was getting 100 USDC rewards claim
- If say a 10% fee on the transfer, they get 90 USDC 
Upgradeability of USDC puts protocol at risk of being unable

### PoC

Token transfers are blocked in instances example

### Mitigation

1. Consider alternative stablecoins like DAI reward token
2. Allow reward tokens to be changeable e.g, setter functions and relevant logic
3. Make contracts Pausable so that any unanticipated change from USDC can be safegurded by pausing contracts
