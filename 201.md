# Lack of Reentrancy Protection in PinlinkShop.sol

#Summary

The ``PinlinkShop.sol`` contract lacks reentrancy protection in key functions, such as ``purchase`` and ``withdrawAsset``, which interact with external tokens (ERC-20 and ERC-1155).

# Vulnerability Details:

- The purchase function transfers tokens using ``safeTransferFrom`` and ``safeTransfer``, which can trigger external calls to malicious contracts.

- The ``withdrawAsset`` function also transfers ERC-1155 tokens, which can be exploited if the recipient is a malicious contract.

- Proof of Concept (PoC):

```solidity
// Malicious ERC-1155 contract reenters during withdrawal
contract MaliciousReceiver {
    function onERC1155Received(address, address, uint256, uint256, bytes memory) public returns (bytes4) {
        // Reenter the withdrawAsset function
        pinlinkShop.withdrawAsset(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, address(this));
        return this.onERC1155Received.selector;
    }
}
```


This could allow an attacker to drain funds or manipulate the contract state.

# Recommendations:

- Use the ReentrancyGuard modifier from OpenZeppelin to protect functions that interact with external contracts.

- Apply the checks-effects-interactions pattern to ensure state changes are made before external calls.
