# Malicious users will pollute the marketplace interface with fake listings

### Summary

The absence of a zero-amount check in the `PinLinkShop::modifyListing` function will cause user experience degradation for marketplace participants as malicious actors will create persistent zombie listings with zero available items.

### Root Cause

In `PinLinkShop::modifyListing` line 269, there is a missing check on the listing's amount parameter, allowing updates to listings that have no items available for sale.

```solidity
function modifyListing(bytes32 listingId, uint256 usdPricePerFraction, uint256 newDeadline)
        external
        onlySeller(listingId)
    {
@>        if (usdPricePerFraction > 0) {
            _listings[listingId].usdPricePerFraction = usdPricePerFraction;
            emit PriceUpdated(listingId, usdPricePerFraction);
        }
        if (newDeadline > 0) {
            require(newDeadline > block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());
            _listings[listingId].deadline = newDeadline;
            emit DeadlineExtended(listingId, newDeadline);
        }
    }
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to create a legitimate listing with any amount of tokens
2. User needs to completely delist all tokens from the listing, setting amount to 0
3. Listing's deadline needs to be greater than `block.timestamp`

### External Pre-conditions

1. Oracle price updates need to occur regularly to ensure valid USD pricing, as stale oracle data would prevent new legitimate listings from competing with zombie listings
2. Network gas prices need to be low enough to make the attack economically viable for griefing
3. Marketplace frontend needs to lack filtering logic for zero-amount listings (implementation detail outside the smart contract)
4. User activity on the platform needs to be high enough that the pollution of listings creates meaningful friction

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates multiple legitimate listings on the marketplace with minimal amounts
2. Attacker delists all items from these listings using the delist function, reducing their amounts to 0
3. Attacker repeatedly calls `modifyListing` on these zero-amount listings to extend deadlines
4. As the contract has no mechanism to remove zero-amount listings, they persist indefinitely
5. Users querying the marketplace see these expired listings mixed with legitimate ones

### Impact

The marketplace users suffer degraded user experience and increased friction when browsing listings. The protocol does not suffer direct financial loss, but may experience reduced activity if users become frustrated with the marketplace interface. The attack is primarily griefing in nature, as the attacker must pay gas fees without direct financial gain.

### Mitigation

Add a check in the `modifyListing` function to verify that the listing's amount is greater than zero:

```diff
function modifyListing(bytes32 listingId, uint256 usdPricePerFraction, uint256 newDeadline)
        external
        onlySeller(listingId)
    {
+       require(listing.amount > 0, "Listing has no items");
        if (usdPricePerFraction > 0) {
            _listings[listingId].usdPricePerFraction = usdPricePerFraction;
            emit PriceUpdated(listingId, usdPricePerFraction);
        }
        if (newDeadline > 0) {
            require(newDeadline > block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());
            _listings[listingId].deadline = newDeadline;
            emit DeadlineExtended(listingId, newDeadline);
        }
    }
```
