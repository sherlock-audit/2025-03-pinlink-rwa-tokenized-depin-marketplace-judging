# Price Staleness & Expired Data Risk (Even with Trusted Owner)

## Description
The CentralizedOracle contract relies on manual price updates by the trusted owner. If the owner forgets or fails to update the price within 7 days, the price is considered stale, and the contract returns 0. This can cause significant issues for DeFi protocols that depend on this oracle for accurate price data.

## Impact
Failed Transactions: DeFi protocols relying on this oracle may experience failed transactions due to the oracle returning a price of 0.
Liquidity Pool Malfunctions: Stale price data can cause liquidity pools to malfunction, leading to arbitrage risks and potential financial losses.
Trading Halts: Integrated protocols may halt trading due to invalid price feeds, disrupting the market and causing loss of trust.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L11

Deploy Contract: Deploy the CentralizedOracle contract with an initial price.
Wait for Staleness Threshold: Do not update the price for more than 7 days.
Observe Stale Price: Attempt to use the oracle, and observe that it returns a price of 0.

## Exploit Scenario
The contract is deployed with an initial price of 1 USD.
The owner forgets to update the price for more than 7 days.
DeFi protocols relying on the oracle for price data start receiving a price of 0, causing failed transactions, liquidity pool malfunctions, and trading halts.

## Mitigation
Automate Price Updates: Implement automated price updates using off-chain data sources to ensure that the price is always up-to-date.
Use Decentralized Oracles: Integrate decentralized oracles to aggregate price data from multiple sources, reducing the risk of stale data.
Alert Mechanisms: Implement alert mechanisms to notify the owner or responsible parties when the price update is due.
Code Example for Mitigation
Automated Price Updates Implementation
```solidity
// ...existing code...
import {ChainlinkClient, Chainlink} from "lib/chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/ChainlinkClient.sol";

contract CentralizedOracle is IPinlinkOracle, ERC165, Ownable, ChainlinkClient {
    // ...existing code...

    address private oracle;
    bytes32 private jobId;
    uint256 private fee;

    constructor(address token_, uint256 initialPriceInUsd_, address _oracle, bytes32 _jobId, uint256 _fee) Ownable(msg.sender) {
        TOKEN = token_;
        oracle = _oracle;
        jobId = _jobId;
        fee = _fee;

        // ...existing code...
    }

    function requestPriceUpdate() public {
        Chainlink.Request memory request = buildChainlinkRequest(jobId, address(this), this.fulfill.selector);
        sendChainlinkRequestTo(oracle, request, fee);
    }

    function fulfill(bytes32 _requestId, uint256 _price) public recordChainlinkFulfillment(_requestId) {
        _tokenPriceInUsd = _price;
        lastPriceUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        emit PriceUpdated(_price);
    }

    // ...existing code...
}
```
By implementing these mitigations, the contract can ensure that the price data remains up-to-date, reducing the risk of stale data and maintaining the reliability of the oracle for dependent DeFi protocols.
