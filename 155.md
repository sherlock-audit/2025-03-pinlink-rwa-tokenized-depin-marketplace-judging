# Admin could list the withdrawn assets for sale again, causing users to buy un-withdrawable assets.

### Summary

When a user withdraw an asset, the withdrawn balance is give back to the REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT so that rewards would be accumulated. However this lets the admin list assets without having the actual assets in the contract, and if users purchase they wont be able to withdraw. Basically the admin could sell all the assets and list them again, gaining 2x the sale amount, at the cost of users not being able to withdraw but receiveing rewards. The withdrawn assets cant be deposited back as there wont be enough assets to handle the accounting pf the contract.

### Root Cause

In [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts%2Fsrc%2Fmarketplaces%2FpinlinkShop.sol#L352), 
```solidity
    function withdrawAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, address receiver) external {
        if (_nonListedBalance(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender) < amount) revert NotEnoughUnlistedTokens();

        // this does't transfer the assets, but only the internal accounting of staking balances
@>      streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(msg.sender, REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, amount);

        emit FractionsWithdrawn(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, receiver);
        IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(address(this), receiver, tokenId, amount, "");
    }
```
In [list()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts%2Fsrc%2Fmarketplaces%2FpinlinkShop.sol#L489-L520) it checks the `stakedBalance` to ensure the seller has enough balance to list.

```solidity
    function _list(
        address fractionalAssets,
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 amount,
        uint256 usdPricePerFraction, // usd price with 18 decimals
        uint256 deadline
    ) internal returns (bytes32 listingId) {
        listingId = keccak256(
            abi.encode(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, amount, usdPricePerFraction, deadline, block.number)
        );

        require(amount > 0, ExpectedNonZeroAmount());
        require(deadline > block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());
        require(usdPricePerFraction > 0, ExpectedNonZeroPrice());
        require(_listings[listingId].seller == address(0), ListingIdAlreadyExists());

@>      if (amount > _nonListedBalance(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender)) revert NotEnoughUnlistedTokens();
...
```

This allows the controller of the REWARDS_PROXY_ADDRESS (admin) to list assets that are not in the contract. If users buy those assets they can get rewards and they wont be able to withdraw. And withdrawn assets cant be deposited back. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

Admin needs to list the withdrawn assets. 

### External Pre-conditions

Users need to purchase and withdraw the assets.

### Attack Path

none.

### Impact

Protocol gets double the sales for an amount of assets, at the cost of first buyers not being able to receive rewards and the second buyers receiving rewards but not being able to withdraw.
