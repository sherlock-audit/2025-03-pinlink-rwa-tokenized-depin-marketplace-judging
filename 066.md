# Buyer Will Acquire Fractions Without Paying Seller Due to Fee Rounding

### Summary

Integer division truncation in PinlinkShop.sol will cause a complete loss of payment for sellers as a buyer will exploit low-value purchases to reduce paymentForSeller to zero.

### Root Cause

In [PinlinkShop.sol:L288](github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L288) and [L534-L545](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L534), the calculation of paymentForSeller uses integer division, which truncates fractional values. If totalPinPayment is too small, paymentForSeller rounds down to 0, allowing buyers to acquire fractions without compensating the seller.

paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;

### Internal Pre-conditions

Seller lists an asset with usdPricePerFraction * fractionsAmount such that totalPinPayment (after oracle conversion) is small

### External Pre-conditions

1. Oracle price (_tokenPriceInUsd) is high enough to make totalPinPayment small (e.g., 1 USD = 1e18 PIN).

2. Buyer sets maxTotalPinAmount to allow the transaction (e.g., maxTotalPinAmount = 1).

### Attack Path

1. Seller lists an asset with usdPricePerFraction = 1.

2. Buyer calls purchase() with fractionsAmount = 1.

3. Oracle converts totalUsdPayment = 1e18 USD to totalPinPayment = 1e15 * 1e18 / 1e18 = 1e18

4. paymentForSeller calculation: paymentForSeller = 1e18 * (10_000 - 500) / 10_000 = 0 

5. Seller receives 0 PIN, while the buyer pays only fees = 1e18.

### Impact

The seller suffers a 100% loss of the listed fractions (receives 0 PIN), while the buyer acquires the fractions for near-zero cost (only pays protocol fees).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Enforce Minimum Seller Payment: require(paymentForSeller > 0, "Seller payment must be > 0");
2. Minimum Price Check: Require usdPricePerFraction to be above a threshold
