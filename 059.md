# Missing amount validation in `modifyListing()` allows gas waste through empty listing updates

### Summary

The missing amount validation in `PinlinkShop::modifyListing()` can cause unnecessary gas costs for users as they can update price and deadline of completely delisted or fully purchased listings.

### Root Cause

The `pinlinkShop::modifyListing()` function does not validate that the listing has a non-zero amount before allowing price and deadline updates.

Here is the `modifyListing()` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L269-L282

A seller may want to extend the deadline or increase the price as he sees a higher demand. So he initiates a transaction to update the price or deadline of the listing. However, it is possible that in the mean time all the fractions have been purchased, so the transaction will still succeed but waste gas as the listing that can never be purchased

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A listing must exist with `amount` equal to 0 (fully delisted or fully purchased)

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Seller creates a listing with some amount
2. Seller or buyers reduce the listing amount to 0 through `delist()` or `purchase()`
3. Seller calls `modifyListing()` to update price or deadline of the empty listing
4. The transaction succeeds but wastes gas as the listing can never be purchased due to having 0 amount

### Impact

The seller suffers unnecessary gas costs (loss of funds) by being able to update parameters of an empty listing that can never be purchased. The gas cost could be reduced if the transaction reverts instead of performing the storage changes and emitting events.

### PoC

Add the following test to `modifyListing.t.sol`:

```solidity
function test_modifyListing_updatePriceAndDeadline_delistedListing() public {
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    // delist all fractions
    pshop.delist(listingId, 30);

    Listing memory listing = pshop.getListing(listingId);
    assertEq(listing.amount, 0);

    uint256 newPrice = 1234e18;
    uint256 newDeadline = listing.deadline + 4 days;

    pshop.modifyListing(listingId, newPrice, newDeadline);

    Listing memory updatedListing = pshop.getListing(listingId);
    assertEq(updatedListing.usdPricePerFraction, newPrice);
    assertEq(updatedListing.deadline, newDeadline);
}
```

### Mitigation

Add a check in `modifyListing()` to revert if the listing amount is 0:

```diff
function modifyListing(bytes32 listingId, uint256 usdPricePerFraction, uint256 newDeadline)
    external
    onlySeller(listingId)
{
+   if (_listings[listingId].amount == 0) revert ListingEmpty();

    if (usdPricePerFraction > 0) {
        _listings[listingId].usdPricePerFraction = usdPricePerFraction;
        emit PriceUpdated(listingId, usdPricePerFraction);
    }
    if (newDeadline > 0) {
        require(newDeadline > block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());
        _listings[listingId].deadline = newDeadline;
        emit DeadlineExtended(listingId, newDeadline);
    }
}
```
