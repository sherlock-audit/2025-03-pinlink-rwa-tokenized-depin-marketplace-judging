# Large USD Price Per Fraction May Cause Purchase to Revert Due to PIN Transfer Limit and PIN Wallet balance llimit

### Summary

The purchase function in the contract may revert when processing payments if the seller sets an excessively high usdPricePerFraction. This is because the PIN token transfer is limited by maxTxRatio and maxWalletRatio, and the calculated totalPinPayment may exceed this limit. As a result, buyers may be unable to complete a purchase when PIN prices increase, causing unexpected failures.

### Root Cause

In purchase(), the function _handlePayments() calls IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom() to transfer PIN tokens. However, the PIN token contract enforces a max transaction size limit in the `_transfer` function:
```solidity
require(amount <= totalTokens / maxTxRatio, "Max tx exceeded.");
```
and also max wallet balance:
```solidity
balanceOf(to) + amount <= totalTokens / maxWalletRatio,
```
If usdPricePerFraction is too high, totalPinPayment can exceed this max transfer limit, leading to a revert.

totalTokens is set to 100000000000000000000000000 in PIN contract, and maxTxRatio/maxWalletRatio can be set to 9,999
so amount should be less than 100000000000000000000000000 / 9,999

### Internal Pre-conditions

The seller sets a high usdPricePerFraction in the listing.
The PIN token contract enforces a max wallet ration (totalTokens / maxWalletRatio).
The buyer attempts to purchase a large number of fractions.

### External Pre-conditions

The price of PIN increases significantly in the oracle.

### Attack Path

A seller creates a listing with an extremely high usdPricePerFraction.
A buyer calls purchase(), and totalPinPayment is calculated based on the oracle price.
If totalPinPayment exceeds totalTokens / maxWalletRatio or totalTokens / maxTxRatio, the transaction reverts.
The buyer is unable to complete the purchase.

### Impact

The buyer cannot complete the purchase, leading to failed transactions. This may cause frustration for users and disrupt marketplace operations.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Implement a check to prevent usdPricePerFraction from being set too high, ensuring that totalPinPayment never exceeds totalTokens / maxTxRatio or totalTokens / maxWalletRatio
