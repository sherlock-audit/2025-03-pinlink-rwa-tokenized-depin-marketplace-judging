# No Expiration Check in modifyListing

### Summary

The modifyListing function allows the seller of a listing to update its usdPricePerFraction and/or deadline. However, it does not check whether the listing has already expired (i.e., block.timestamp >= listing.deadline) before allowing modifications. This omission enables sellers to modify expired listings, which can lead to confusion, unintended behavior in the marketplace, and potential exploitation by malicious actors. In a well-designed marketplace, expired listings should either be immutable or explicitly handled (e.g., delisted), but the current implementation permits changes that undermine the integrity of the listing system.



### Root Cause

Here’s the relevant code from the PinlinkShop contract:
```solidity

function modifyListing(bytes32 listingId, uint256 usdPricePerFraction, uint256 newDeadline)
    external
    onlySeller(listingId)
{
    if (usdPricePerFraction > 0) {
        _listings[listingId].usdPricePerFraction = usdPricePerFraction;
        emit PriceUpdated(listingId, usdPricePerFraction);
    }
    if (newDeadline > 0) {
        require(newDeadline > block.timestamp, "DeadlineHasExpiredAlready");
        _listings[listingId].deadline = newDeadline;
        emit DeadlineExtended(listingId, newDeadline);
    }
}

modifier onlySeller(bytes32 listingId) {
    address seller = _listings[listingId].seller;
    if (seller == address(0)) revert InvalidListingId();
    if (seller != msg.sender) revert SenderIsNotSeller();
    _;
}
```
Inputs:
listingId: Unique identifier of the listing.

usdPricePerFraction: New price per fraction (optional, 0 to skip).

newDeadline: New expiration timestamp (optional, 0 to skip).

Logic:
Verifies the caller is the seller via the onlySeller modifier.

Updates usdPricePerFraction if provided and non-zero.

Updates deadline if provided, with a check that newDeadline > block.timestamp.

Key Structures:
```solidity

struct Listing {
    address fractionalAssets;
    uint256 tokenId;
    address seller;
    uint256 amount;
    uint256 usdPricePerFraction;
    uint256 deadline;
}
mapping(bytes32 => Listing) internal _listings;
```

vulnerability:

Expiration Definition:
A listing’s expiration is defined by listing.deadline. In the purchase function, purchases are blocked if block.timestamp >= listing.deadline:
solidity

require(block.timestamp < listing.deadline, "ListingDeadlineExpired");

This indicates that an expired listing (where block.timestamp >= deadline) should no longer be active for purchases.

Modification Logic in modifyListing:
Price Update: if (usdPricePerFraction > 0) { ... } updates the price without checking listing.deadline.

Deadline Update: if (newDeadline > 0) { require(newDeadline > block.timestamp, ...); } ensures the new deadline is in the future but does not check the current deadline against block.timestamp.

Result: An expired listing (e.g., deadline = 100, block.timestamp = 150) can still have its usdPricePerFraction updated, or its deadline extended to a future time (e.g., 200).

Comparison with Other Functions:
Delisting: delist allows removing amounts from an expired listing (no deadline check), which is intentional for cleanup.

Purchasing: purchase explicitly prevents actions on expired listings.

Inconsistency: modifyListing lacks this safeguard, allowing changes to listings that should be considered inactive.



### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

The absence of an expiration check is provable because:
State Access: _listings[listingId] is accessed without verifying listing.deadline >= block.timestamp.

Behavior on Expired Listings: For a listing where deadline < block.timestamp:
purchase reverts with ListingDeadlineExpired.

modifyListing succeeds if newDeadline > block.timestamp or if only usdPricePerFraction is updated.

Logical Inconsistency: Modifying an expired listing contradicts the intent of expiration, as it implies the listing is no longer valid for trading until explicitly reactivated with a new deadline.

Example Scenario:
Initial State: Listing listingId has deadline = 100, usdPricePerFraction = 1e18. Current block.timestamp = 150.

Action: Seller calls modifyListing(listingId, 2e18, 0).

Result: usdPricePerFraction updates to 2e18, even though the listing is expired and cannot be purchased.

Further Action: Seller calls modifyListing(listingId, 0, 200) (assuming block.timestamp = 150).

Result: deadline updates to 200, reactivating the listing with the new price 2e18.





### Impact

Marketplace Confusion:
Expired listings appear inactive to buyers (cannot purchase), but sellers can silently update prices, misleading future interactions once the deadline is extended.

Example: A buyer sees an expired listing at 1e18 USD, but after the seller updates it to 2e18 and extends the deadline, the buyer purchases at an unexpected price.

Potential Exploitation:
A malicious seller could:
List assets at a low price to attract attention.

Let the listing expire.

Update the price to a higher value and extend the deadline, tricking buyers into expecting the original price.

This undermines trust in the marketplace’s pricing integrity.

State Inconsistency:
The contract allows modifications to listings that should be immutable or require explicit delisting/re-listing, breaking the expected lifecycle (active → expired → inactive).



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add an expiration check at the start of modifyListing:
```solidity

function modifyListing(bytes32 listingId, uint256 usdPricePerFraction, uint256 newDeadline)
    external
    onlySeller(listingId)
{
    Listing storage listing = _listings[listingId];
    require(block.timestamp < listing.deadline, "ListingExpired");
    if (usdPricePerFraction > 0) {
        listing.usdPricePerFraction = usdPricePerFraction;
        emit PriceUpdated(listingId, usdPricePerFraction);
    }
    if (newDeadline > 0) {
        require(newDeadline > block.timestamp, "DeadlineHasExpiredAlready");
        listing.deadline = newDeadline;
        emit DeadlineExtended(listingId, newDeadline);
    }
}
```
