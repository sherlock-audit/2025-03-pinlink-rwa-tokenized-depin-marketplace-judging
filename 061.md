# Zero fee transfer in `_handlePayments()` leads to failed purchases when protocol fee is zero

### Summary

Missing zero-amount check in `PinlinkShop::_handlePayments()` will cause all purchase transactions to fail when `purchaseFeePerc` is set to 0, as the function attempts to transfer 0 tokens which reverts with `PIN` ERC20 implementation.

### Root Cause

The `PinlinkShop::_handlePayments()` function called as part of `PinlinkShop::purchase()` attempts to transfer fees to `feeReceiver` without checking if the fee amount is zero:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L534-L545

The `fees` can be `0` in purchases when `purchaseFeePerc` is set to `0` via `PinlinkShop::setFee()`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L174-L178

However, the `PIN` ERC20 implementation reverts on zero-amount transfers:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x2e44f3f609ff5aA4819B323FD74690f07C3607c4#code#F1#L291

As result, instead not charging any fees on purchases, the purchases will fail.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call `PinlinkShop::setFee()` to set `purchaseFeePerc` to 0
2. A valid listing must exist
3. A buyer must attempt to purchase from the listing

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Admin sets `purchaseFeePerc` to 0 via `setFee()` to not charge any fees
2. Buyer attempts to purchase tokens from a valid listing
3. In `_handlePayments()`, `fees` is calculated as 0 (`totalPinPayment * 0 / FEE_DENOMINATOR`)
4. The function attempts to transfer 0 PIN tokens to `feeReceiver`
5. The transaction reverts as PIN ERC20 implementations revert on zero-amount transfers

### Impact

1. The protocol becomes completely unusable for its core function (purchasing assets) when fees are set to 0. This breaks core contract functionality and leads to a denial of service for all users trying to make purchases. 
2. The protocol is unable to work without charging any fees.

### PoC

Add the following test to `purchase.t.sol`:

```solidity
function test_purchase_fails_when_fee_is_zero() public {
    vm.prank(admin);
    // Admin sets the fee to 0 to not charge any fees
    pshop.setFee(0);

    uint256 buyAmount = 1;
    uint256 pinAmount = pshop.getQuoteInTokens(listingId3, buyAmount);

    vm.prank(bob);
    vm.expectRevert("Transfer amount must be greater than zero");
    pshop.purchase(listingId3, buyAmount, pinAmount);
}
```

### Mitigation

Add a check for zero fees before attempting the transfer:

```diff
function _handlePayments(address buyer, address seller, uint256 totalPinPayment)
    internal
    returns (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees)
{
    // fees are rounded in favor of the protocol
    paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
    fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;

    // no need to verfy that msg.value==0, because purchases with tokens are done with purchaseWithToken() which is non-payable
    IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, paymentForSeller);
-   IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, feeReceiver, fees);
+   if (fees > 0) {
+       IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, feeReceiver, fees);
+   }
}
```
