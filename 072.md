# A price mismatch between the centralized oracle and the external market price can cause losses to Users.

### Summary

A price mismatch between the centralized oracle and the external market price can cause losses to Sellers.

### Root Cause

The sale of fractional assets in `PinlinkShop` is priced in USD, but can only be paid with Pin tokens, to convert between them, a centralized oracle provide the exchange rate, but this oracle is gonna be updated with a new price by a bot only if 'X' minutes have passed and the price differs from the current oracle price in more than Y%, this create an opportunity for an attacker(bot) or Mev bot to create profits at the expense of users.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Users list their tokens for sale.
2. Centralized oracle price differs from the Market Price and hasn't been updated by the bot.
3. The conversion price between USD - Pin token is not updated to the external market price.
4. Before the centralized oracle update, the attacker buys the fractional tokens on sale for less Pin tokens that the seller expects to receive, causing a loss to the seller.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Mismatch between external market price (Dex, Cex) and the Centralized Pin Oracle.
2. An attacker or a Mev bot buys the fractional assets on sale in the pinlinkshop for less Pin tokens than the sellers expect to receive.

This is an example scenario.
 
1. Some users list their fractional assets for sale in the pinlinkshop market, when they list their tokens the Pin price is 1 USD in the centralized Pin oracle. A user expects to get 10,000 USD after paying fees to the protocol for his fractional tokens, in Pin tokens it would be 10,000 Pin tokens.
2. The price drop in the external markets by 20%, so a Mev bot buys 10,000 Pin tokens in uniswap for 8,000 USD.
3. Before the centralized oracle updates the Pin token Price to 0.80 USD, the Mev bot buys the user's position sending the 10,000 Pin tokens because the centralized oracle is still pricing every Pin token to 1 USD.
4. The user receives his part of the Pin tokens (10,000 Pin tokens) and the fee receiver receives the fee, now the pin tokens are valued at 0.80 USD per token, so the user suffers a loss of 20% in the sale of his fractional tokens.

This scenario could happen to many users and create tons of losses for the sellers in the pinlinkshop contract, due to Mev bot buying the fractional tokens on sale before the centralized oracle updates the Pin price.

If the price in the external market goes up compared to the price of the centralized oracle, the buyers in the protocol could be generating losses in a similar scenario, but this is a scenario that is completely dependent on the buyer's side, so not adding this to the report.

### Impact

losses for the fractional tokens sellers of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

This problem could be solved by implementing a decentralized, or twap oracle that calculates the correct exchange of the Pin/USD pair every time a purchase is made, to avoid having an outdated price injected by the centralized oracle.
