# Admin should deposit rewards not operator

### Title
Admin should deposit rewards not operator

### Severity

### Type

## Description
README.md mentions `Admin deposits rewards earned from the mining hardware in the PinlinkShop for each asset
`
In the current implementation, the `pinlinkShop.sol:depositRewards` function is restricted exclusively to the `OPERATOR_ROLE`. If, in practice, the `OPERATOR_ROLE` is assigned to an entity other than the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, the admin (who holds critical management permissions) won’t be able to deposit rewards.

This design limits flexibility, potentially causing operational bottlenecks or necessitating overly broad role assignments, which reduces protocol security.
```solidity
function depositRewards(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, uint256 drippingPeriod)
    external
@    onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
{
    RewardsStream storage stream = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId];
    stream.depositRewards(amount, drippingPeriod);

    emit RewardsDistributed(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, amount, drippingPeriod);
    IERC20(REWARDS_TOKEN).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
}
```
Here, only the OPERATOR_ROLE can deposit rewards.

## Impact
	•	If roles are separated (e.g., DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE ≠ OPERATOR_ROLE), the admin lacks authority to deposit rewards.
	•	To mitigate, the admin must explicitly assign themselves the operator role, contradicting best practices for role management.
	•	Could create delays or operational friction in reward distribution.

## Recommendations
   change modifier onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE) to onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
