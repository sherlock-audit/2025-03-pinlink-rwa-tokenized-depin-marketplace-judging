# Users Receive 1,000,000x Smaller USDC Rewards Due to Decimal Precision Error in the `claimRewards` Function of `PinlinkShop` Contract

### Summary

In the `claimRewards` Function of `PinlinkShop` Contract, a issue causes users to receive USDC rewards that are 1,000,000 times (1e6) smaller than intended. This occurs because the contract fails to account for USDC's 6 decimal places when transferring reward tokens, effectively reducing all rewards to 0.0001% of their intended value.

### Root Cause

The root cause is a decimal precision mismatch in the rewards distribution system. While the contract correctly handles 18 decimal places for PIN token transfers, it incorrectly treats USDC (which has 6 decimal places) as if it had no decimal places at all.

The issue occurs in the `claimRewards` function:

[marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol:claimRewards#L327-L334](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/34cd70b66f1dbe191bd6f946e42f58eef4a00166/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L327C1-L334C6)
```solidity
function claimRewards(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId) external {
    uint256 claimed = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].claimRewards(msg.sender);
    if (claimed == 0) return;

    IERC20(REWARDS_TOKEN).safeTransfer(msg.sender, claimed); //@audit Issue is here
    emit Claimed(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, claimed);
}
```

The `claimed` value is calculated in `_pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate`:

[marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol:_pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate#L142-L150](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/34cd70b66f1dbe191bd6f946e42f58eef4a00166/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L142C1-L150C6)
```solidity
    /// @dev output is is reward tokens (not scaled by PRECISION)
    function _pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate(RewardsStream storage self, uint256 globalPerStaked, address account)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
        // this can't underflow, because this always holds: `globalRewardsPerStaked() >= updatedRewardsPerStaked[account]`
        return (self.stakedBalances[account] * (globalPerStaked - self.updatedRewardsPerStaked[account])) / PRECISION;
}
```

This calculation produces an integer with no decimal places, but USDC requires 6 decimal places. For comparison, PIN token transfers correctly handle 18 decimal places:

[marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol:_handlePayments#L543](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/34cd70b66f1dbe191bd6f946e42f58eef4a00166/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L543)
```solidity
IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, paymentForSeller);
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The contract is initialized with USDC as the `REWARDS_TOKEN`

### External Pre-conditions

USDC is deposited into the contract as rewards

### Attack Path

This is not an exploitable vulnerability in the traditional sense, but it affects all users:

1. User stakes assets in the PinlinkShop ecosystem
2. Rewards accumulate over time based on staking amount
3. User calls `claimRewards(fractionalAssets, tokenId)`
4. The contract calculates the correct reward amount internally
5. When transferring USDC, the contract fails to adjust for USDC's 6 decimal places
6. User receives only 0.0001% of their entitled rewards

### Impact

1. **Financial Loss**: Users receive only 1/1,000,000th of their entitled rewards
2. **Trapped Funds**: 99.9999% of all rewards remain trapped in the contract
3. **Economic Imbalance**: The reward distribution mechanism becomes effectively non-functional

For example, a user entitled to 100 USDC would receive only 0.0001 USDC, which is below the minimum transaction threshold for most exchanges and wallets.

### PoC


To verify this vulnerability, it assume the following setup:

1. **Setup**:
   - We deploy PinlinkShop with these mock contracts of PIN, USDC, Oracle, and FractionalAssets
   - A user stakes 10 tokens (100% of the total supply)
   - We deposit 1000 USDC as rewards with a 1-day dripping period
   - We fast-forward time to the end of the dripping period

2. **Test**:
   - The user should receive all 1000 USDC (1,000,000,000 in USDC's 6-decimal representation)
   - Due to the precision error, they actually receive only 1000 units (1,000 in raw units, or 0.001 USDC)
   - This confirms the user receives only 0.0001% (1/1,000,000) of their expected rewards

Expected USDC reward: 1000000000
Actually received: 1000
Ratio (received/expected): 0.000001000000000000

### Mitigation

1. **Short-term Fix**: It is recommended to modify the transfer amount in the `claimRewards` function (`claimed * 1e6`). This is the least invasive fix and can be deployed quickly and minimizes risk of unintended side effects.

```solidity
function claimRewards(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId) external {
    uint256 claimed = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].claimRewards(
        msg.sender
    );
    if (claimed == 0) return;

+   uint256 adjustedAmount = claimed * 1e6;  
-   IERC20(REWARDS_TOKEN).safeTransfer(msg.sender,  claimed);
+   IERC20(REWARDS_TOKEN).safeTransfer(msg.sender, adjustedAmount);
-   emit Claimed(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, claimed);
+   emit Claimed(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, adjustedAmount);
}
```

2.**Long-term Solution**: Design a comprehensive precision handling system that clearly distinguishes between internal calculation precision and transfer precision for various tokens, which could be implemented in the next major version update and include explicit constants for token decimals and standardized conversion functions.
