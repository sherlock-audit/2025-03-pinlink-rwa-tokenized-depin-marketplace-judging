# Delayed Reward Distribution Due to `depositRewards()` Dependency on `enableAsset()`

### Summary

The requirement that `enableAsset()` must be called before `depositRewards()` will cause a delay in reward accrual for stakers as rewards cannot be deposited until the asset is explicitly enabled. This prevents early buyers from accruing rewards upon purchasing fractional assets, reducing the attractiveness of the marketplace.

### Root Cause

In `StreamHandler.sol:depositRewards()`, the logic requires that the asset has already been enabled. Else, the call will be denied including any possible batch reward deposits over multiple `tokenId` crafted by the operator, leading to missed early rewards for would be stakers arising from a purchase. This is because `drippingPeriod` can be as long as [15 days](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L54) during which `enableAsset()` can be called shortly after `self.lastDepositTimestamp` allowing `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` to list the token assets for sale. If buyers made their purchase, there would be a time gap where buyers receive zero rewards before the next `depositRewards()` call could be attempted again. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `enableAsset()` has not been called for a specific `tokenId`.

2. An operator attempts to call `depositRewards()` before the asset is enabled.

3. The transaction reverts because `self.isEnabled()` is false.

### External Pre-conditions

1. A token ID for a `fractionalAssets` already exists with `totalSupply != 0`.

2. The protocol expects rewards to be distributed across multiple token IDs in a batch, but some are not yet enabled.

### Attack Path

1. A new fractionalized asset is created with a valid `tokenId` and `totalSupply > 0`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/fractional/FractionalAssets.sol#L26-L31

```solidity
    function mint(uint256 tokenId, address to, uint256 assetSupply) external onlyRole(MINTER_ROLE) {
        if (assetSupply == 0) revert FractionalAssets_InvalidTotalSupply();
        if (totalSupply(tokenId) != 0) revert FractionalAssets_TokenIdAlreadyExists();

        _mint(to, tokenId, assetSupply, "");
    }
```
2. `depositRewards()` is denied (DoS) because `!self.isEnabled()` is true.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L92

```solidity
        if (!self.isEnabled()) revert PinlinkRewards_AssetNotEnabled();
```
3. Just shortly after that, [`enableAsset()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L193-L206) is called where `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` [lists](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L489-L520) the token ID assets for sale.

4. Buyers [purchase](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L288-L325) fractions, expecting to earn rewards.

5. Since [`depositRewards()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L208-L218) has earlier been denied and not yet been called post-enablement, there is a time gap where no rewards are earned.

6. Buyers receive no rewards until `depositRewards()` is called again, which has no definite timeframe when this will be done again. For instance, the rewards earlier meant for the tokenId may have been distributed to other tokenId that has been enabled and the operator might have to wait for available rewards before they could call or batch call `depositRewards()` again. The protocol might also come to a point where it would stick to schedules, e.g. every 15 to 20 days to distribute rewards perhaps in batches across all existing tokenId associated with a particular `fractionalAssets`. 

7. Had it not been due to the restraint (that could actually be lifted with proper refactoring) entailed, the first batch of early buyers could have at least been entitled to rewards for the remaining time of `drippingPeriod` in the event `depositRewards()` would not have been called again for quite some time.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L122-L124

```solidity
        uint256 locked = (timeSinceDeposit > _drippingDuration)
            ? 0
            : self.deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked * (_drippingDuration - (timeSinceDeposit)) / _drippingDuration;
```
### Impact

The stakers (buyers) suffer a delay in reward accrual, leading to missed earnings. This issue significantly impacts the attractiveness of the protocol for early buyers. Newly listed assets become less competitive, as buyers prefer assets with immediately active rewards accrual. Additionally, the longer the time between buyers' purchase till the next `depositRewards()`, the larger the reward gap for early adopters.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify `depositRewards()` in StreamHandler.sol to ensure it does not require `enableAsset()` beforehand, while still respecting `self.isEnabled()`. Here's a suggested fix:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L208-L218

```diff
    function depositRewards(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, uint256 drippingPeriod)
        external
        onlyRole(OPERATOR_ROLE)
    {
        RewardsStream storage stream = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId];

-        stream.depositRewards(amount, drippingPeriod);

+        if (stream.isEnabled()) {
+            stream.depositRewards(amount, drippingPeriod);
+        else {
+            uint256 assetSupply = IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).totalSupply(tokenId);
+            if (assetSupply == 0) revert ExpectedNonZero();
+            stream.updateRewards(REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT);
+            stream.stakedBalances[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT] = assetSupply;
+            stream.depositRewards(amount, drippingPeriod);
+        }

        emit RewardsDistributed(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, amount, drippingPeriod);
        IERC20(REWARDS_TOKEN).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    }
```
Remove the redundant check in `StreamHandler.depositRewards()`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L91-L92

```diff
        if (!self.isDrippingPeriodFinished()) revert PinlinkRewards_DepositRewardsTooEarly();
-        if (!self.isEnabled()) revert PinlinkRewards_AssetNotEnabled();
```
Add a check similar as in `pinlinkShop._deposit()` to `_list()`: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L496-L498

```diff
+        if (!streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].isEnabled()) revert AssetNotEnabled();
        listingId = keccak256(
            abi.encode(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, amount, usdPricePerFraction, deadline, block.number)
        );
        require(usdPricePerFraction > 0, ExpectedNonZeroPrice());
        require(_listings[listingId].seller == address(0), ListingIdAlreadyExists());
```
