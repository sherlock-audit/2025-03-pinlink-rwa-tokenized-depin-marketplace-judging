# Arithmetic underflow or overflow while depositing

### Summary

The missing check in `pinlinkShop.sol:527` for amounts desposited will cause an Arithmetic Underflow/Overflow Error

### Root Cause

In `pinlinkShop.sol:527` there is a missing check `NotEnoughTokens()` on the _deposit function for checking the amount the user intends to deposit. The function proceeds to deposit the amount directly without validation, and this could cause an arithmetic underflow/overflow issue.

### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

- User needs to withdraw assets from the protocol 
- User needs to deposit the withdrawn assets back to the pool but with a slight difference

### Attack Path

## This is how it works
- User withdraw assets from the protocol and the rewards are directed to the feeReceiver e.g 15
- User comes back to re-deposit the assets back to the pool but with an increased amount e.g 16

### Impact

- User is unable to re-deposit and may not be aware of what went wrong.

### PoC

```solidity

function test_depositAsset_Overflow() public {
        //User withdrawer some assets 
        _doWithdraw(address(fractions), asset1, 15, alice);


       //User intend to re-deposit the assets back ito the pool with a slight difference, 16
        uint256 amount = 16;
        uint256 balanceBefore = fractions.balanceOf(alice, asset1);

        console.log(balanceBefore);

       //This deposit will fail as a result of arithmetic overflow / underflow 
       // expecting NotEnoughTokens() Error message.
        vm.prank(alice);
        pshop.depositAsset(address(fractions), asset1, amount);

        assertEq(fractions.balanceOf(alice, asset1), balanceBefore - amount);
    }

```

### Mitigation

Add a check to validate the amount before depositing it

if (withdrawnAmount < amountToBeDeposited) revert NotEnoughTokens();
