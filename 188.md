# The oracle will cause buyers to overpay or be denied service due to outdated prices.

### Summary

The check in the function [`updateTokenPrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L56):

```solidity
if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();

```

will cause buyers to either overpay if they want to purchase a listing, or permanent DOS (because of the slippage)

### Root Cause

In `CentralizedOracle.sol`, the lack of a mechanism to update the price when it drops by more than 80% prevents buyers from accessing the true market price.

- In `CentralizedOracle.sol:57`, the check for price decreases is insufficient, allowing the price to remain outdated. This function is callable only by the admin (the bot), which should be trusted to manage price updates effectively.

As the sponsors have stated in the README there would be a bot updating the price every X minutes (X would be chosen later). However, this price cannot be updated if it drops by more than 80 % in the span of X minutes and the functions that use this price would use the old price.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There should be active listings in pinlinkShop.sol.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The market price of the USD/PIN pair should drop by more than 80% within a short time frame (a few minutes)

### Attack Path

1. The market price of the token drops significantly (e.g., from $1.00 to $0.19).
2. Buyers attempt to purchase fractional assets at the outdated higher price provided by the oracle.
3.1. *the buyer set correct slippage* Due to slippage protection, the transaction fails if the actual price exceeds the maximum amount the buyer is willing to pay, resulting in a denial of service.
3.2. *the buyer did not care about slippage* Buyer overpayed the fractional assets bought, as it used outdated price

### Impact

Buyers suffer a loss as they are forced to overpay based on the outdated price, or they are denied the ability to purchase assets altogether due to slippage protection. Sellers are also affected as the inability of buyers to complete transactions leads to reduced sales.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the following check, as the function is only callable by the admin and they are trusted.

```solidity
if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
```
