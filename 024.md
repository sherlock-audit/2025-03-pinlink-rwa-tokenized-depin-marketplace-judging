# Price volatility will cause sellers to receive fewer PIN tokens than expected

### Summary

The lack of a slippage protection mechanism for sellers will cause a potential loss in PIN tokens for sellers as price volatility leads to fewer PIN tokens received during a purchase.

### Root Cause

The choice to not include a minimum PIN token setting for sellers in the `list` function is a mistake as it exposes sellers to the risk of receiving fewer PIN tokens when the oracle’s PIN token price fluctuates.

The [`list`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/34cd70b66f1dbe191bd6f946e42f58eef4a00166/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L236) function allows users to list their fractional assets for sale, specifying a price in USD per fraction (`usdPricePerFraction`):

```solidity
/// @notice lists a certain amount of fractions of a tokenId for sale, with the price denominated in USD (18 dps)
/// @dev two identical listings sent in the same block by the same seller will revert due to a conflicting listingId
function list(
    address fractionalAssets,
    uint256 tokenId,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 usdPricePerFraction, // usd price with 18 decimals
    uint256 deadline
) external returns (bytes32 listingId) {
    listingId = _list(
        fractionalAssets,
        tokenId,
        amount,
        usdPricePerFraction,
        deadline
    );
}
```

However, in the `purchase` function, the buyer pays in `PIN` tokens, converted from USD using the oracle’s `convertFromUsd` at the time of purchase:

```solidity
/// @notice allows a buyer to purchase a certain amount of fractions from a listing
/// @dev The buyer pays in PIN tokens, but the listing is denominated in USD.
/// @dev An oracle is used internally to convert between PIN and USD
/// @dev the maxTotalPinAmount protects from slippage and also from a malicious sellers frontrunning the purchase and increasing the price
function purchase(
    bytes32 listingId,
    uint256 fractionsAmount,
    uint256 maxTotalPinAmount
) external {
    ...

    uint256 totalUsdPayment = listing.usdPricePerFraction * fractionsAmount;
    uint256 totalPinPayment = IPinlinkOracle(oracle).convertFromUsd(
        address(PIN),
        totalUsdPayment
    );

    if (totalPinPayment == 0) revert StaleOraclePrice();
    if (totalPinPayment > maxTotalPinAmount) revert SlippageExceeded();

    // transfers the payment to the seller and the fees to the feeReceiver
    // note: ERC20 with callbacks (ERC777) are not supported, so the following should be safe
    (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees) = _handlePayments(
        msg.sender,
        seller,
        totalPinPayment
    );
    ...
    
}
```

Buyers can limit slippage with `maxTotalPinAmount`, but sellers have no equivalent protection.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Sellers `list` their fractional assets with a fixed USD price per fraction using the list function.

2. The contract does not allow sellers to specify a minimum PIN token amount.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The oracle’s PIN token price increases between the time of listing and the time of purchase.

### Attack Path

1. A seller calls the `list` function with a specific `usdPricePerFraction`.
2. The PIN token price increases over time.
3. A buyer calls the purchase function to buy the fractions.
4. The contract calculates the PIN token payment using the current oracle price, resulting in fewer PIN tokens transferred to the seller.

### Impact

Sellers suffer a potential loss in the number of PIN tokens received due to the lack of slippage protection, receiving fewer PIN tokens than expected if the PIN token price increases after listing.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the list function to include a `minPinPerFraction` parameter. In the purchase function, ensure the seller receives at least this amount per fraction.
