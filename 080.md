# Some transactions may be blocked temporarily by the Pin token.

### Summary

big buyers and sellers could see this transaction blocked temporarily by some Pin token features, causing a gas loss, and users will have to spend more gas to buy a big amount of fractional assets using more than one transaction, this also could incentivize whale users to sell/buy fractional tokens in another way outside of the Pinlink market, where the protocol will not receive fees for it and the use of the Pin token can be disincentivized.

### Root Cause

The Pint token limits the amount of pin tokens that can be transferred in a transaction, and also the amount of tokens that any wallet can have, these limitations can temporarily block buys/sells transactions for some users in the Pinlink market, big sell or buys can be blocked, which will cause loss of gas for the users, and will cause that a big buyer or big seller has to spend more gas to buy the amount of fractional assets they need/want.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. A whale lists a big sale in the market or wants to do a big buy in the market.
2. The Pin token has a `maxTxRatio` or a `maxWalletRatio` configured in a point that the amount listed by the whale will revert when another user(whale) tries to buy the amount listed. 

### External Pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Check POC section

### Impact

Users will lose gas spend in the transaction, and they will be forced to spend more gas to buy fractional assets that represent a big amount of Pin tokens because they will have to split a buy in many transaction more.

### PoC

When users want to sell fractional assets,  they have to list them in the market, so any other user can buy them using Pin tokens.

If a User wants to sell fractional tokens that represent a big amount of Pin tokens, he will list them in the Pinlink market, so when a buyer tries to buy them all using the Pin tokens, this transaction could revert because the Pin token limit the amount of Pin tokens that can be transfer in one transaction (`maxTxRatio`) and also limit the amount of Pin tokens a wallet can have (`maxWalletRatio`), if these parameters are configured in a range that block the amount of Pin tokens needed to buy the fractional assets, the transaction will revert causing a gas loss for the users. 

The users will have to buy the fractional assets in more than one transaction, so they will spend more gas, this can disincentivize whale users to sell their tokens in the Pinlink market causing a lose of fees for the protocol or even disincentivize the use of Pin tokens to sell their fractional assets.

From the Pin token code `0x2e44f3f609ff5aA4819B323FD74690f07C3607c4`:
```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) private {
        //Code omitted
             // Max tx check
            require(amount <= totalTokens / maxTxRatio, "Max tx exceeded.");
          // ...
      // Max wallet check
         require(balanceOf(to) + amount <= totalTokens / maxWalletRatio, "Max wallet will be exceeded.");
      //Code omitted
}
```

This is a test I added in the `purchase.t.sol` file to show that a big the transaction reverts with the error: `revert: Max wallet will be exceeded`

```solidity
// in the setup function change this line:
listingId3 = pshop.list(address(fractions), asset1, 25, 10_000e18, block.timestamp + 3 days);

function test_purchase_MaxWalletExceeded_PinTokens() public {
        uint256 listedBalanceBefore = _listedBalance(address(fractions), asset1, alice);

        vm.prank(pinOwner);
        IPinToken(address(PIN)).setMaxWalletRatio(100);

        uint256 buyAmount = 25;
        _doPurchase(listingId3, buyAmount, bob);

        assertEq(_listedBalance(address(fractions), asset1, alice), listedBalanceBefore - buyAmount);
    }
```

### Mitigation

It is difficult to give a mitigation for this because it depends on what the protocol wants to do in these situations, maybe they want to keep these transactions blocked, or if they want to allow them, they could whitelist the address that can do big buys and sells, or they may want to change the configuration of the `maxTxRatio` or a `maxWalletRatio`  configurations in the Pin token.
