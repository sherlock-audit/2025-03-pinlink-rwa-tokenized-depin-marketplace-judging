# Oracle owner will manipulate asset prices affecting all traders

### Summary

The centralized price oracle design will cause unfair trading conditions as the oracle owner can manipulate prices within generous bounds, allowing them to profit at traders' expense.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L52

### Root Cause

In [pinklink_audit/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace-king-null/issues/pinklink_audit/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L42-L56) the oracle allows immediate price updates within a 5x range with no time delay or additional security measures.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The oracle owner can update prices with only basic bounds checks
Price updates take effect immediately with no delay or time lock
The allowed price change range of 1/5× to 5× is extremely wide

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

Oracle owner monitors the mempool for large purchase or listing transactions
When they see a target transaction, they front-run it with a price update
For buys, they increase the price up to 5x the current price, making purchases much more expensive
For listings, they decrease the price, making sellers get much less value
After the target transaction executes, they restore the price to the original value
They can also position themselves to benefit from these price movements

### Impact

Users could pay up to 5x more for assets or receive as little as 1/5 of the fair value for their listings, resulting in significant financial losses proportional to transaction sizes.

### PoC

```solidity
function testOracleManipulationAttack() public {
    // Setup: Initialize with 1 USD per PIN token
    
    // User's transaction: Buying $1000 worth of fractions
    uint256 fractionsToBuy = 100;
    uint256 usdTotalPrice = 1000e18; // $1000 with 18 decimals
    uint256 fairPinPayment = 1000e18; // 1000 PIN (assuming 1:1 rate)
    
    // Front-run: Oracle owner updates price to 5 USD per PIN
    vm.prank(oracleOwner);
    oracle.updateTokenPrice(5e18);
    
    // User's transaction now executes with new price
    uint256 manipulatedPinPayment = usdTotalPrice / 5; // Now only 200 PIN for same purchase
    
    // User pays 5x more USD value than they should have
    // Attacker profits from this price difference
    uint256 lossToUser = fairPinPayment - manipulatedPinPayment;
    assertEq(lossToUser, 800e18); // 800 PIN tokens of value lost
}

```

### Mitigation

Implement a time-weighted average price (TWAP) mechanism
Add a mandatory time delay between price updates (at least 1 hour)
Consider using a decentralized oracle solution like Chainlink
Tighten the allowed price change to maximum 20% per update
Require multiple independent oracle providers to validate price changes
