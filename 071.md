# Price update constraints create asset mispricing and oracle deadlock during volatility

### Summary

The restrictive price update constraints in the CentralizedOracle contract will cause both asset mispricing and system-wide deadlock for the PinLink protocol as market volatility exceeding 5x will prevent proper price updates and block the ability to replace the oracle.

### Root Cause

In `CentralizedOracle.sol:56-57` the implementation enforces price update restrictions that don't account for cryptocurrency market volatility:
```solidity
if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();
```
This impacts two different functions which rely on the price from the oracle:
1. [pinlinkShop.sol::purchase():314](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L314)
2. [pinlinkShop.sol::setOracle():184-185](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L184)

It is important to note that price updates must be done manually. Furthermore, the problem is exasperated as both of the aforementioned functions will receive the USD price as `0` if the `lastPriceUpdateTimestamp` exceeds the `STALENESS_THRESHOLD`:
```solidity
if ((block.timestamp - lastPriceUpdateTimestamp) > STALENESS_THRESHOLD) {
    return 0;
}
```  

In the case of the former, sudden price change without a price update will impact purchases and if the staleness threshold were to be exceeded, users will be denied service due to this [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L316):
```solidity
if (totalPinPayment == 0) revert StaleOraclePrice();
```

In the case of the  latter, If the price exceeds the threshold without an update, the oracle used by the protocol cannot be changed due to this [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L185):
```solidity
// a stale oracle will return 0. Potentially this also validates the oracle has at least 18dp
uint256 testValue = IPinlinkOracle(oracle_).convertToUsd(PIN, 1e18);
if (testValue < 1e6) revert InvalidOraclePrice();
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The price of PIN token compared to its last updated oracle price needs to decrease by more than 80% (or increase by more than 500%).
2. The oracle needs to remain without updates for 7 days to exceed the `STALENESS_THRESHOLD`.

### External Pre-conditions

1. PIN token market price needs to experience a sharp movement (crash or pump) exceeding the 5x threshold within a short timeframe.
2. The market price needs to remain beyond the 5x threshold for more than 7 days, preventing price updates before staleness.

### Why these scenario shouldn't be considered impossible or unimaginable:
Firstly, cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and could expand up or down in a short timeframe for numerous reasons:
1. Organic price action due to hype. The picture below shows another cryptocurrency [Zerebro](https://dexscreener.com/solana/3sjnocnkkhwpvxygdtem8rccihsgc9jsfzuuazkbvrvp) going from: ~$64M MCAP -> ~$455M MCAP within a 7 day timeframe, showing that it is not improbable for a token at the current PIN MCAP to go on a parabolic run. Although it can be argued that the protocol will have CRON jobs that automatically update the price of the oracle daily, these jobs could be silently failing / fail when the protocol receives large traffic (parabolic price increase = more traffic). This is just one example but there have been instances of tokens going 10x in a single day (BOME).

2. The PIN token could go > -80% in a single candle for multiple reasons:
- The PIN contract itself is exploited.
- A DEX hack.
- If a large % of PIN has been given to CEXs for partnership/market making and the CEX were to get hacked.
- Lack of capital inflows and lackluster Price Action in the foreseeable future and a single entity / multiple large entities that hold a large % of the supply can cause rapid price moevement due to market selling.
- The protocol decides to have L2 functionality in a future upgrade and allows bridging, the bridge then gets hacked.

With both the above considered, while it is improbable, it is not impossible for massive price adjustments in a short time frame. 

The likelihood should be deemed Low.


### Attack Path

1. Market volatility or a market event causes PIN token price to move more than 5x from the last reported oracle price.
2. The oracle operator attempts to update the price but the transaction reverts due to the 5x limitation checks.
3. The oracle remains unable to update the price for 7 days, exceeding the `STALENESS_THRESHOLD`.
4. The oracle now returns 0 for all price conversion requests as it has become stale.
5. The protocol admin attempts to replace the oracle with a new one by calling `setOracle()`.
6. The `setOracle()` function fails because the validation check requires the new oracle to return a non-zero value, but a reasonable new oracle would return the current market price which triggers the sanity checks.

### Impact

The PinlinkShop protocol suffers a complete system failure as:

1. Users experience significant mispricing during asset purchases:
- If PIN price has crashed, sellers pay far more value than intended
- If PIN price has pumped, buyers pay far less than intended
2. Once the oracle becomes stale, all purchase operations fail completely as the price conversion returns 0, rendering the marketplace non-functional.
3. The protocol admin is unable to replace the oracle to resume operations, creating a permanent deadlock that would require a contract upgrade to resolve.

### Severity 
The impact is High whereas the likelihood is Low (described ealier).

Overall: **Medium**

### PoC

N/A - sufficient information has been provided above and the attack vector is simple to understand.

### Mitigation

1. Adjustable Price Change Limits:
- Implement an admin function that can temporarily increase the allowed price change limits during high volatility periods
- Add an emergency mode that allows bypassing the 5x limitation with multi-sig approval
2. Fail-safe Oracle Replacement:
- Modify the setOracle() function to include an emergency override parameter that allows replacing a stale oracle without price validation
3. Allow setting a new oracle even if the current one is stale, provided the new one implements the correct interface
4. Circuit Breaker:
- Implement market circuit breakers that pause trading functionality during extreme volatility
- Add a protocol pause mechanism that activates automatically if the oracle becomes stale
