# Reward Manipulation Through Zero-Amount Deposits

## Vulnerability Details

The `depositAsset` function in the `PinlinkShop` contract lacks validation to ensure that the deposit amount is greater than zero. This allows users to call the function with an `amount` parameter of zero, which still triggers the internal reward update mechanism.

[pinlinkShop.sol::depositAsset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L364)

```solidity
function depositAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external {
    _deposit(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount);
}
```

The function calls `_deposit`, which in turn calls `transferBalances` on the stream object:

```solidity
// Inside _deposit function (implied)
streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(msg.sender, REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, amount);
```

The `transferBalances` function calls `updateRewards` internally, which updates the reward state for the user. This means that even with a zero amount, the rewards calculation is triggered and updated.

## Impact

This vulnerability can lead to several significant issues:

1. **Reward Calculation Manipulation**: Users can artificially trigger reward updates at times beneficial to them by calling `depositAsset` with zero amounts, potentially gaming the reward system.

2. **Gas Consumption Attack / DOS**: Malicious actors could repeatedly call the function with zero amounts to waste gas and congest the network, especially if there are many users or assets in the system. Also, can create a DOS by creating huge amounts of calls on the function.

3. **Accounting Inconsistencies**: Frequent zero-amount deposits could lead to precision errors in reward calculations due to rounding issues that accumulate over multiple unnecessary updates.

4. **Event Spam**: If deposit events are emitted, zero-amount deposits would create misleading transaction logs, making it harder to track legitimate activity.

## Mitigation

To address this vulnerability, implement a validation check at the beginning of the `depositAsset` function:

[pinlinkShop.sol::depositAsset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L364)

```solidity
function depositAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external {
    require(amount > 0, "PinlinkShop: deposit amount must be greater than zero");
    _deposit(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount);
}
```

This simple check ensures that only meaningful deposit operations are processed, preventing users from artificially triggering reward updates without actually depositing any assets. This is consistent with best practices for input validation in smart contracts and protects the integrity of the reward calculation system.
