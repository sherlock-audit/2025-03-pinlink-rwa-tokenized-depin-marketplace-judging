# Fees are not charged from the buyer

### Summary

By the protocol design, the fee is supposed to be charger every purchase from the buyer:
>The `purchaseFeePerc` is the fee taken on every purchase in PIN tokens. This value can be updated by DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, but cannot exceed 10%.

Although technically purchase fee indeed are transfered from the buyer, but due to flawed logic in calculations the fee will actually be charged from the seller instead, leading to selling assets at a discounted price.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/34cd70b66f1dbe191bd6f946e42f58eef4a00166/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L538-L544)

As we can see, the buyer should pay 2 amounts: 
1. price of purchased fractions;
2. purchase fee.

```solidity
// fees are rounded in favor of the protocol
paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;

// no need to verfy that msg.value==0, because purchases with tokens are done with purchaseWithToken() which is non-payable
IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, paymentForSeller);
IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, feeReceiver, fees);
```
The issue is that the purchase fee is subtracted from the price of fractions, not applied on top of the price. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

Seller should list some amount of fractional asset.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Amelie listed 10 fractions with `usdPricePerFraction` = 10 `PIN`, so she expects to receive 100 `PIN` if someone will buy her fractions;
2. Bob wants to buy the fractions and calls `purchase()` - so he should pay price of fractions + purchase fee - 100 + 5 `PIN` (assume `purchaseFeePerc` = 500 or 5%)
3. But fees are charger from seller's payment instead, so technically buyer will pay only price of fractions:
```solidity
paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR; //100 * 9500 / 10000 = 95 PIN
fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller; //100 - 95 = 5 PIN

IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, paymentForSeller); //95 PIN
IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, feeReceiver, fees); //5 PIN
```

### Impact

The seller suffers 5% loses from sold fractions, the buyer will avoid paying purchase fee that should be taken on every purchase.

### PoC

No need

### Mitigation

Purchase fee is supposed to be applied on top of the price of purchased fractions.
