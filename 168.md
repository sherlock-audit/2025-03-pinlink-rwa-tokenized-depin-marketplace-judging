# Rounding Error in Fee Calculation Allows Protocol to Absorb Extra Funds

### Summary

The test results confirm a rounding error vulnerability in the fee calculation mechanism. When handling payments, the contract applies a percentage-based fee using integer division, leading to a situation where small rounding errors accumulate. In this specific case, the fee amount is slightly larger than expected, causing the protocol to absorb extra funds that should belong to the seller or buyer. The test failure explicitly shows that extra fees of 50.05 PIN were taken due to rounding discrepancies.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability originates from integer division rounding errors in the _handlePayments function inside PinlinkShop.sol. Solidity does not support floating-point arithmetic, so integer division always truncates the result.

Breakdown of the Issue:
Fee Calculation with Integer Division

```solidity
paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;
```
Here, (totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc)) / FEE_DENOMINATOR performs integer division.
If totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) is not perfectly divisible by FEE_DENOMINATOR, the result is truncated (i.e., rounded down).
The remaining fraction gets added to fees, leading to slightly higher fees than expected.

### Internal Pre-conditions

For the rounding error vulnerability to be triggered, the following conditions must hold:

Integer Division in Fee Calculation:

The function _handlePayments performs division:
```solidity

paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;
```
If totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) % FEE_DENOMINATOR != 0, then rounding occurs, leading to truncation.
Non-Uniform Token Amounts (Not Multiples of Fee Denominator):

If totalPinPayment is not an exact multiple of FEE_DENOMINATOR, then division will round down.
This causes paymentForSeller to be lower than expected, and the protocol fees (fees) to be higher than expected.
High Fee Percentage Increases the Effect:

The higher the purchaseFeePerc, the more tokens get affected by rounding.
For example, if purchaseFeePerc = 5%, then the rounding impact is less severe than if purchaseFeePerc = 10%.
Token Amounts Must Be Large Enough for Rounding to Matter:

Small totalPinPayment values may not trigger the issue significantly.
If totalPinPayment is large, the cumulative effect of rounding over many transactions becomes noticeable.

### External Pre-conditions

A buyer initiates a purchase, triggering a payment calculation.
The _handlePayments function splits the payment, dividing it into seller payout and protocol fees.
Rounding errors occur due to integer division, causing slight miscalculations in payment distribution.
The seller receives less than expected, and the buyer is overcharged due to fee miscalculations.

### Attack Path

Buyer initiates a purchase by calling purchase, specifying asset fractions and a maximum allowed payment in PIN tokens.
Oracle converts USD price to PIN tokens, determining the required payment.
Payment is processed in _handlePayments, where the sellerâ€™s payout and protocol fee are calculated.
Rounding errors occur in fee calculation, causing the seller to receive less than expected and the buyer to be overcharged.
Fee receiver does not receive the excess amount, resulting in lost funds.

### Impact

Repeated purchases lead to cumulative extra fees that are effectively lost.
Sellers receive slightly less than expected over multiple transactions.
Buyers pay slightly more than intended, creating a trust issue.
The fee receiver may collect an unpredictable amount, impacting revenue.
