# Precision Scaling Error in globalRewardsPerStaked() Function Leads to Excessive Reward Distribution


## Summary
The `globalRewardsPerStaked()` function returns a value calculated as `globalRewardsPerStakedTarget - locked`, where both values are scaled by PRECISION (e.g., 1e18). However, the function fails to divide by this scaling factor, resulting in rewards being inflated by a factor of PRECISION. This critical error causes devastating miscalculations in reward payouts. Additionally, there's a potential underflow risk if `locked` ever exceeds `globalRewardsPerStakedTarget` due to improper deposit handling.

## Vulnerability Details

#### Affected Function:
`globalRewardsPerStaked()`

#### Root Cause:
- **Missing Precision Division**: The function returns `self.globalRewardsPerStakedTarget - locked` without dividing by PRECISION, resulting in values PRECISION times larger than intended
- **Potential Underflow**: If `locked` ever exceeds `globalRewardsPerStakedTarget` through improper deposit timing, the subtraction operation would underflow and revert

## Impact
- **Massively Inflated Rewards**: Users receive PRECISION times more tokens than intended (e.g., 1e18x excess)
- **Protocol Insolvency**: The contract's reward reserves could be rapidly depleted
- **Denial-of-Service Risk**: Underflow scenarios could block legitimate transactions

## Proof of Concept

Scenario: Incorrect Reward Calculation
**Input:**
- amount = 1000 (reward tokens)
- assetSupply = 1000 (staked tokens)
- PRECISION = 1e18

**Calculation:**
- delta = (1000 * 1e18) / 1000 = 1e18
- globalRewardsPerStakedTarget += 1e18
- After dripping period: globalRewardsPerStaked() returns 1e18 (instead of 1)

**Result:** A user with 1 staked token would receive 1 * 1e18 rewards (instead of 1 token)

## Mitigation

**Step 1: Divide by PRECISION in globalRewardsPerStaked()**
```solidity
function globalRewardsPerStaked(RewardsStream storage self) internal view returns (uint256) {
    // ... existing code ...
    return (self.globalRewardsPerStakedTarget - locked) / PRECISION; // Add division
}
```
