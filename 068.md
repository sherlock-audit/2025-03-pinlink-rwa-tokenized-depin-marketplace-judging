# Incorrect Deadline Validation

### Summary

The contract allows sellers to modify listing deadlines through the modifyListing() function:

function modifyListing(bytes32 listingId, uint256 usdPricePerFraction, uint256 newDeadline)
    external
    onlySeller(listingId)
{
    if (usdPricePerFraction > 0) {
        _listings[listingId].usdPricePerFraction = usdPricePerFraction;
        emit PriceUpdated(listingId, usdPricePerFraction);
    }
    if (newDeadline > 0) {
        require(newDeadline > block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());
        _listings[listingId].deadline = newDeadline;
        emit DeadlineExtended(listingId, newDeadline);
    }
}
The Problem

Minimal Future Requirement: The only validation is that the deadline must be greater than the current block timestamp (block.timestamp). This means a deadline could be set to just 1 second in the future.

Ethereum Block Time Reality: Ethereum blocks are produced approximately every 12-15 seconds, and transaction inclusion isn't guaranteed in the next block. A deadline that's too close to the current time might expire before a transaction can be included.

Mempool Exploitation: A malicious seller could monitor the mempool for purchase attempts and front-run them with a modifyListing() call that sets the deadline to a time that will have passed by the time the buyer's transaction is processed.

No Minimum Time Window: There's no minimum time window (e.g., 1 hour or 1 day) that ensures buyers have a reasonable opportunity to complete purchases.

Example Attack Scenario

A seller lists an asset with a reasonable deadline (e.g., 7 days in the future).

A buyer sees the listing and submits a purchase() transaction.

The seller monitors the mempool, sees the incoming purchase, and quickly submits a modifyListing() transaction with a higher gas price.

The seller's transaction sets the deadline to current time + 2 seconds.

The seller's transaction gets processed first due to higher gas.

By the time the buyer's transaction is processed, the deadline has expired.

The buyer's transaction reverts with ListingDeadlineExpired().

The seller keeps their asset while forcing the buyer to waste gas on a failed transaction.


Purchase Function Check

The purchase function does check for deadline expiration:
solidityCopyrequire(block.timestamp < listing.deadline, ListingDeadlineExpired());

However, this check only protects against purchases after the deadline, not against malicious deadline manipulation right before a purchase.

### Mitigation


A more secure implementation would:

Enforce Minimum Time Window: Require deadlines to be at least a certain period in the future (e.g., 1 hour).

Prevent Short Extensions: When modifying a deadline, require the new deadline to be at least a minimum period after the modification time.

Deadline Change Cooldown: Implement a cooldown period during which a seller cannot modify a deadline after a recent modification.


function modifyListing(bytes32 listingId, uint256 usdPricePerFraction, uint256 newDeadline)
    external
    onlySeller(listingId)
{
    // Price update logic
    
    if (newDeadline > 0) {
        // Require at least 1 hour in the future
        require(newDeadline > block.timestamp + 1 hours, "Deadline must be at least 1 hour in the future");
        
        // Optional: prevent frequent deadline changes
        require(block.timestamp > _lastDeadlineUpdate[listingId] + 6 hours, "Cannot update deadline more than once every 6 hours");
        
        _listings[listingId].deadline = newDeadline;
        _lastDeadlineUpdate[listingId] = block.timestamp;
        emit DeadlineExtended(listingId, newDeadline);
    }
