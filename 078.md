# Front-running oracle price updates enables profit through arbitrage at users' expense

## Description:
The protocol's `CentralizedOracle` is vulnerable to front-running attacks when updating token prices. The oracle allows extreme price movements in a single update - up to 80% decrease or 400% increase:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L56-L57
```solidity
if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();
```

These extraordinarily wide boundaries create a massive attack surface for arbitrage-based attacks. A malicious actor can monitor the mempool for oracle update transactions and front-run them with their own transactions.

When an attacker sees a pending price increase:
1. Attacker identifies a pending transaction that will increase PIN price (e.g., from 0.05 USD to 0.20 USD, a 300% increase which is within the allowed 400% maximum)
2. Attacker quickly purchases assets at the current lower price (paying fewer PIN tokens)
3. After the price update executes, attacker can sell these assets at the new higher price
4. This creates a risk-free arbitrage profit at the expense of other users

Example calculation:
 - Attacker buys asset for 100 USD when PIN = 0.05 USD: Pays 2000 PIN
- PIN price updates to 0.20 USD (a 300% increase, still below the maximum 400% allowed)
- Attacker sells asset for 100 USD at new price: Receives 500 PIN
- Profit: 1500 PIN tokens (75% return) from a single transaction

## Impact:
- Risk-free arbitrage opportunities for attackers monitoring the mempool
- Users consistently transact at suboptimal prices
- The protocol explicitly allows extreme price movements in a single update:
   - Price decreases of up to 80% 
   - Price increases of up to 400%

## Recommended Mitigation:
Implement a time-delay mechanism for price updates
Significantly narrow the acceptable price change boundaries
Consider implementing a Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) mechanism instead of instant price updates despite the fact that, as stated in the developers' comments, it's cheaper to run a centralized oracle.
