# Missing Rewards Balance Check Causes Arithmetic Underflow in Deposits

### Summary

Calls to `depositAsset` and `depositAndList` will revert with the error `panic: arithmetic underflow or overflow (0x11)` when a user attempts to deposit assets. This happens because the deposit functions subtract an amount from the `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` balance without ensuring that sufficient funds are available. Since the `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` balance is only increased during withdrawals, deposits made without prior withdrawals trigger an arithmetic underflow.  


### Root Cause


In the deposit functions, the following line is executed in `_deposit(...)` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L528)  
```solidity
streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, msg.sender, amount);
```  
Inside the `transferBalances` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L74):  
```solidity
function transferBalances(RewardsStream storage self, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    self.updateRewards(from);
    self.updateRewards(to);
    self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount; // Underflow occurs if `stakedBalances[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT]` is less than `amount`
    self.stakedBalances[to] += amount;
}
```  
If the balance of `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` is insufficient (which is common since it is only increased by `withdrawAsset`), the subtraction underflows and causes the transaction to revert.  


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. **Insufficient REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT Balance:** The internal balance `stakedBalances[REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT]` is lower than the deposit amount.  
2. **Deposit on Enabled Asset:** The asset is enabled in the ecosystem, and the user calls `depositAsset` or `depositAndList` with an amount exceeding the available `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` balance.  
3. **No Prior Withdrawal:** The `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` balance has not been replenished by a prior call to `withdrawAsset`.  

### External Pre-conditions

1. **Lack of Withdrawals:** External actors have not called `withdrawAsset` to boost the `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` balance.  
2. **Standard Reward Deposit Flow:** Although `depositRewards` deposits rewards into the stream, it does not affect the balance required for deposit transfers.  

### Attack Path

1. **Asset Enablement:** An admin enables an asset using `enableAsset`.  
2. **Reward Deposit:** An operator deposits rewards via `depositRewards`, which does not increase the `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` balance.  
3. **Asset Purchase:** A user (e.g., Alice) purchases asset fractions through the `purchase` function.  
4. **Deposit Attempt:** The user then attempts to deposit the purchased assets using `depositAsset` or `depositAndList`.  
5. **Underflow Triggered:** The function `transferBalances(REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT, msg.sender, amount)` subtracts `amount` from an insufficient balance, causing an arithmetic underflow and reverting the transaction with `panic: arithmetic underflow or overflow (0x11)`.  



### Impact

Users are blocked from depositing assets into the rewards system due to arithmetic underflow. This prevents them from depositing their assets and receiving rewards until a withdrawal occurs to replenish the `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` balance, thereby disrupting normal platform participation.

### Mitigation

- Avoid subtracting from the `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` balance during deposit operations.
