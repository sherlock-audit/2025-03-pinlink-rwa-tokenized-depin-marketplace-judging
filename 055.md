# Read-Only Reentrancy in getPendingRewards

### Summary

The PinlinkShop.getPendingRewards view function can return stale reward values during a reentrant call (e.g., via withdrawAsset), misleading external protocols or users relying on it. This occurs because StreamHandler.getPendingRewards reflects the current state, not the final state after a transaction.

### Root Cause

In StreamHandler.getPendingRewards:

```solidity
function getPendingRewards(RewardsStream storage self, address account) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 globalPerStaked = self.globalRewardsPerStaked();
    return self.pendingRewards[account] + self._pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate(globalPerStaked, account);
}
```
Accessed via PinlinkShop.getPendingRewards, it uses stakedBalances and globalRewardsPerStaked without accounting for in-progress state changes.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- Attacker controls a contract with staked fractions and pending rewards.
- A state-changing operation (e.g., withdrawAsset) is in progress.

### External Pre-conditions

- Attacker triggers reentrancy via onERC1155Received and calls getPendingRewards

### Attack Path

- Attacker stakes 100 fractions (tokenId=1).
- OPERATOR deposits 100 USDC rewards, fully dripped.
- Attacker calls withdrawAsset for 50 fractions.
- During safeTransferFrom, onERC1155Received reenters getPendingRewards, returning 100 USDC (based on 100 fractions).
- withdrawAsset completes, reducing the balance to 50 fractions, but an external protocol acts on the stale 100 USDC value.

### Impact

- External contracts or users misjudge reward amounts, potentially leading to over-allocations or incorrect decisions.
- No direct fund loss in PinlinkShop, but impacts downstream reliability.

```

### Mitigation

- Apply nonReentrant to getPendingRewards to prevent reentrant calls.
- Document the view functionâ€™s potential staleness for external integrators.
