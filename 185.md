# Incorrect msg.sender Handling in enableAsset Leads to Transfer Failure

### Summary

Admin calls `mint` in `FractionalAssets.sol` where he mints tokens to himself. Then admin calls `enableAsset` to enable the fractionalAsset and transfer it to the `pinLinkShop.sol`. However this actually doesn't work exactly like that when admin calls transfer the totalSupply of fractionalAsset to contract because:

```solidity
 IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId, assetSupply, "");
```
We call it in `pinLinkShop.sol` and since FractionalAsset is a different contract we externally call safeTransferFrom logic of ERC1155 inside `FractionalAssets` contract. Which makes msg.sender to be not the admin address but the pinLinkShop address.

### Root Cause

In PinLinkShop.sol, the `enableAsset` function attempts to transfer the total supply of a fractional asset from the admin to the contract using:

```solidity
IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId, assetSupply, "");
```

However, since safeTransferFrom is an external call to the FractionalAssets contract (an ERC1155 implementation), the msg.sender inside FractionalAssets becomes PinLinkShop.sol instead of the admin. This causes the transfer to fail because PinLinkShop.sol does not own the tokens nor have approval to transfer them on behalf of the admin.

```solidity
 function enableAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, address receiver)
        external
        onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
    {
        RewardsStream storage stream = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId];

        if (stream.isEnabled()) revert AlreadyEnabled();

        uint256 assetSupply = IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).totalSupply(tokenId);
        stream.enableAsset(assetSupply, receiver);

        emit AssetEnabled(fractionalAssets, tokenId, assetSupply, msg.sender, receiver);
        IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId, assetSupply, ""); //@audit
    }
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

None

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Impact will be revert  of the `enableAsset` function. Which will make the whole protocol unusable.

The enableAsset function will fail when attempting to transfer the fractional asset, preventing assets from being enabled and moved to PinLinkShop.sol. This breaks the expected workflow where assets should be transferred and staked in the rewards system. As a result, the admin cannot proceed with enabling assets, leading to a blocked state where users cannot utilize the intended features.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace with:

```solidity
function enableAsset(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, address receiver)
        external
        onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
    {
        RewardsStream storage stream = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId];

        if (stream.isEnabled()) revert AlreadyEnabled();

        uint256 assetSupply = IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).totalSupply(tokenId);
        stream.enableAsset(assetSupply, receiver);
        address caller = msg.sender; //<----
        emit AssetEnabled(fractionalAssets, tokenId, assetSupply, msg.sender, receiver);
        IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(caller, address(this), tokenId, assetSupply, ""); 
    }                                                        -----
