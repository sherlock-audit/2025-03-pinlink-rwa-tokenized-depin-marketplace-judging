# Reward Manipulation Through Timing Attacks

### Summary

The PinLink protocol contains a critical vulnerability in its reward distribution mechanism that exposes the system to timing-based attacks. The current implementation fails to properly adjust rewards based on the timing of stake and unstake operations, allowing users to maximize rewards through strategic timing of their actions. By staking immediately after rewards are deposited and unstaking once most rewards have been distributed, attackers can extract a disproportionate share of rewards relative to their average staked time.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability arises from the reward calculation mechanism, which does not adequately account for the timing of stake and unstake operations. The core issue lies in how rewards are calculated and distributed over time.

The reward calculation in the `getPendingRewards` function only considers the current state without factoring in the timing of stake changes:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L145-L152

```solidity
function getPendingRewards(RewardsStream storage self, RewardsInfo storage info, uint256 stakedAmount) internal view returns (uint256) {
    if (stakedAmount == 0) return info.pendingRewards;
    if (!self.isEnabled()) return info.pendingRewards;

    uint256 globalRewardsPerStaked = self.globalRewardsPerStaked();

    if (globalRewardsPerStaked <= info.rewardDebt) return info.pendingRewards;
    return info.pendingRewards + stakedAmount * (globalRewardsPerStaked - info.rewardDebt) / PRECISION;
}
```

Additionally, the `updateRewards` function simply updates rewards based on the current global rewards rate without considering time-weighted contributions:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L129-L143

```solidity
function updateRewards(RewardsStream storage self, RewardsInfo storage info, uint256 stakedAmount) internal {
    if (!self.isEnabled()) return;

    uint256 globalRewardsPerStaked = self.globalRewardsPerStaked();

    if (stakedAmount > 0 && globalRewardsPerStaked > info.rewardDebt) {
        info.pendingRewards += stakedAmount * (globalRewardsPerStaked - info.rewardDebt) / PRECISION;
    }

    info.rewardDebt = globalRewardsPerStaked;
}
```

The dripping mechanism in `depositRewards` distributes rewards linearly without protection against timing attacks:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L85-L102

```solidity
function depositRewards(RewardsStream storage self, uint256 amount, uint256 drippingPeriod) internal {
    if (drippingPeriod > MAX_DRIPPING_PERIOD) revert PinlinkRewards_DrippingPeriodTooLong();
    if (drippingPeriod < MIN_DRIPPING_PERIOD) revert PinlinkRewards_DrippingPeriodTooShort();

    if (!self.isDrippingPeriodFinished()) revert PinlinkRewards_DepositRewardsTooEarly();
    if (!self.isEnabled()) revert PinlinkRewards_AssetNotEnabled();

    // This ensures rounding errors are negligible (less than 0.01$ per deposit)
    if (amount < MIN_REWARDS_DEPOSIT_AMOUNT) revert PinlinkRewards_AmountTooLow();

    // The number of fractions per asset is expected to be on the order of 100.
    // Thus, precision loss will usually be negligible (on the order of less than 100 wei)
    // Therefore, precision loss is deliberately ignored here to save gas
    uint256 delta = (amount * PRECISION) / self.assetSupply;
    /// The dripping mechanism is to avoid step jumps in rewards
    self.globalRewardsPerStakedTarget += delta;
    self.deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked = delta;
    self.lastDepositTimestamp = block.timestamp;
    self.drippingPeriod = drippingPeriod;
}
```


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin/protocol needs to periodically call the deposit function to add rewards to the staking pool
2. Users need to be able to freely stake and unstake tokens without time restrictions
3. Users need to be able to observe reward deposits and quickly respond

Example: An admin deposits 1000 tokens as rewards with a drip rate of 1 token per second. A strategic user who monitors the system can stake right after this deposit and unstake after 900 seconds, capturing 90% of the rewards while only committing capital for a fraction of the intended participation period.

### External Pre-conditions

The attack is most profitable when the opportunity cost of capital is low, such as in periods of stable market conditions when capital isn't needed for other high-yield opportunities.

### Attack Path

1. User monitors the system and observes an admin depositing rewards into the staking pool
2. User immediately stakes a significant amount of tokens after the reward deposit
3. User calculates the optimal time to unstake based on the reward rate and distribution period
4. User unstakes all tokens and claims rewards after most rewards have been distributed
5. User repeats this process with each new reward deposit, maximizing rewards while minimizing capital commitment

This strategy can be systematically executed to extract disproportionate rewards from the system, unfairly disadvantaging users who maintain long-term stakes.

### Impact

**High**. This vulnerability affects multiple stakeholders:

1. **Protocol**: Experiences a breakdown of its incentive mechanism, failing to properly reward long-term participation as intended
2. **Honest stakers**: Receive diluted rewards despite their longer commitment and alignment with protocol goals
3. **Protocol sustainability**: May suffer as strategic stakers extract short-term value without contributing to long-term stability

Example: If the protocol intends to incentivize 30-day staking periods to promote stability, but attackers can claim 90% of rewards with just 7 days of staking through timing attacks, the protocol loses its ability to encourage sustained participation. This creates a "first-mover advantage" where those who can act quickly after reward deposits effectively claim most of the rewards intended for long-term participants.

### PoC

The following proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the reward timing vulnerability to extract more rewards than an honest staker with the same stake amount but a longer staking duration:

// The underlying implementation is vulnerable because it does not include the time-weighted component in the rewards calculation.

// which is vulnerable to timing attacks:
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L62-L78

```solidity
function globalRewardsPerStaked(RewardsStream storage self) internal view returns (uint256) {
    if (!self.isEnabled()) return 0;

    // If the dripping period has finished or no dripping in progress, 
    // return the current fixed global rewards per staked
    if (self.isDrippingPeriodFinished()) {
        return self.globalRewardsPerStakedCurrent;
    }

    // Calculate the progress of the dripping period (0-100%)
    uint256 elapsed = block.timestamp - self.lastDepositTimestamp;
    uint256 progress = elapsed * 100 / self.drippingPeriod;
    if (progress > 100) progress = 100;

    // Return current value plus the proportional part of the delta
    return self.globalRewardsPerStakedCurrent + self.deltaGlobalRewardsPerStaked * progress / 100;
}
```

This code shows the linear dripping of rewards over time, which an attacker can exploit through strategic timing.

### Mitigation

Several complementary approaches can be implemented to address this vulnerability:

1. **Implement a time-weighted reward distribution system** that rewards staking duration:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L345-L363

The stake function should be modified to record stake time:

```solidity
// Add time tracking to RewardsInfo struct
struct RewardsInfo {
    uint256 pendingRewards;
    uint256 rewardDebt;
    uint256 lastStakeTime; // New field to track stake time
    uint256 stakeDuration; // New field to track cumulative stake duration
}

// Modify stake function to record stake time
function stake(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external {
    // existing code...
    
    // Record stake time in the rewards info
    RewardsInfo storage info = _getUserRewardsInfo(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender);
    info.lastStakeTime = block.timestamp;
    
    // existing code...
}
```

2. **Implement a vesting schedule for rewards**, where rewards are locked for a period after claiming:

```solidity
struct RewardsInfo {
    uint256 pendingRewards;
    uint256 rewardDebt;
    uint256 vestedRewards;
    uint256 vestingEndTime;
}

function claimRewards(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId) external {
    // existing code...
    
    // Instead of immediately transferring rewards, put them in vesting
    RewardsInfo storage info = _getUserRewardsInfo(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender);
    info.vestedRewards += calculatedRewards;
    info.vestingEndTime = block.timestamp + VESTING_PERIOD;
    
    // existing code...
}

function withdrawVestedRewards(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId) external {
    RewardsInfo storage info = _getUserRewardsInfo(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender);
    require(block.timestamp >= info.vestingEndTime, "Rewards still vesting");
    
    uint256 amount = info.vestedRewards;
    info.vestedRewards = 0;
    
    // Transfer the vested rewards
    rewardsToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

3. **Implement a lockup period for stakes** that prevents immediate unstaking after receiving rewards:

```solidity
function stake(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external {
    // existing code...
    
    // Record stake time and set lockup period
    RewardsInfo storage info = _getUserRewardsInfo(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender);
    info.stakeLockupUntil = block.timestamp + MINIMUM_STAKE_PERIOD;
    
    // existing code...
}

function unstake(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external {
    RewardsInfo storage info = _getUserRewardsInfo(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender);
    require(block.timestamp >= info.stakeLockupUntil, "Stake is still locked");
    
    // existing unstaking code...
}
```

By implementing these mitigations, the protocol can align its reward system with the intended incentives, ensuring that users who consistently support the platform are appropriately rewarded and strategic short-term staking for reward extraction is discouraged.

### Key Takeaways

1. **Time-weighted incentives matter**: Reward systems that fail to account for staking duration create perverse incentives that favor strategic timing over long-term participation.

2. **Design for long-term alignment**: An effective staking system should reward behaviors aligned with the protocol's long-term success, such as consistent participation and reliability.

3. **Consider behavioral economics**: Attackers can exploit pure economic incentives to extract maximum value with minimal contribution; mitigation strategies should account for these behaviors.

4. **Test reward distribution scenarios**: Protocols should simulate various staking strategies to identify potential exploitation vectors before deployment.

5. **Avoid linear distribution without protection**: Simple linear reward distribution without time-weight multipliers, lockups, or vesting schedules are vulnerable to timing exploits.

6. **Create balanced incentive structures**: Implementing multiple complementary mitigation strategies (time-weighted rewards, vesting, lockups) creates a more robust reward system that properly aligns incentives across different user behaviors.
