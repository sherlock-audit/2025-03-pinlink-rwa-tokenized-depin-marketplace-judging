# Reentrancy Risk in FractionalAssets Transfer

### Summary

An external attacker can exploit the safeTransferFrom call in PinlinkShop.withdrawAsset via the onERC1155Received callback to reenter and claim USDC rewards before state updates, leading to disproportionate reward extraction.

### Root Cause

In PinlinkShop.withdrawAsset:

```solidity
IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(address(this), receiver, tokenId, amount, "");
```
The external call occurs after transferBalances updates stakedBalances, allowing reentrancy into claimRewards before the transaction finalizes.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Attacker controls a contract with staked fractions and pending rewards.
2. Asset is enabled with accrued USDC rewards.

### External Pre-conditions

1. Attacker calls withdrawAsset with their malicious contract as receiver.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker stakes 100 fractions (tokenId=1) in PinlinkShop.
2. OPERATOR deposits 100 USDC rewards, fully dripped after 1 day.
3. Attacker calls withdrawAsset for 50 fractions, triggering onERC1155Received.
4. Callback reenters claimRewards, claiming 100 USDC based on the pre-update balance (100 fractions).
5. withdrawAsset completes, reducing stakedBalances to 50 fractions, but the attacker keeps 100 USDC.

### Impact

- Attacker extracts excess USDC (e.g., 100 USDC instead of 50 USDC), violating reward proportionality.
- Protocol loses funds, undermining trust and staking integrity.

### Mitigation

- Add OpenZeppelinâ€™s ReentrancyGuard and mark withdrawAsset as nonReentrant.
