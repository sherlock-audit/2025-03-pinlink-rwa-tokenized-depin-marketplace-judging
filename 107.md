# Malicious Actor Can Manipulate Oracle Price to Buy RWA Fractions Below Market Value

### Summary

A restrictive price update mechanism in the `CentralizedOracle` will cause an economic loss for sellers in the PinLink marketplace as an attacker will manipulate the PIN token’s market price using a flash loan and exploit the stale oracle price to purchase asset fractions at a steep discount.

### Root Cause

In `CentralizedOracle.sol` ([lines 56-58](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L56-L57)), the `updateTokenPrice` function includes sanity checks that restrict new prices to a range of `(usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5 and usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5)`. This design choice prevents the oracle from reflecting extreme but legitimate market price changes, such as a 7x drop for example in the PIN token’s value. As a result, if an attacker manipulates the market price below this threshold e.g., from $10 to $1.42 which is exactly 7x drop and this is not hard to accomplish because the PIN token currently has very low liquidity, as of writing this report only ~$24K available on PancakeSwap. So using these two conditions — an inflexible oracle and a manipulable token price — an attacker can force the oracle to remain stale at an outdated price (e.g., $10) while crashing the market price (e.g., to $1.42), enabling the `purchase` function in `pinlinkShop` to accept undervalued PIN payments.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The bot fails to update `_tokenPriceInUsd` in CentralizedOracle after the market price drops below with more than 5 times of the current oracle price due to the restrictive sanity checks.
2. As well as  there is currently no way to manually update the price in such cases. Which makes this attack even easier to be performed.



### External Pre-conditions

1. The PIN/USDT liquidity pool on PancakeSwap needs to have low liquidity, as it currently stands at approximately $24K as of March 14, 2025, allowing an attacker to manipulate the PIN price from $10 to $1.42 with a feasible flash loan amount.



### Attack Path

1. The attacker identifies a valuable listing in PinlinkShop, such as an L9 Miner with 100 fractions listed at $100 per fraction (total $10,000 needed to be paid in PIN token), where the current PIN price is $10 i.e 1000 PIN tokens will be required to acquire all of the fractions
2. The attacker takes a USDT flash loan from Aave and dumps it into a PIN/USDT pool on PancakeSwap, crashing the PIN market price from $10 to $1.42 (a 7x drop).
3. The off-chain bot attempts to update the oracle price via `updateTokenPrice`, but the new price ($1.42) is below the minimum threshold ($10 / 5 = $2), causing the transaction to revert with `PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow`.
4. The oracle price remains stale at $10, while the market price stays at $1.42.
5. The attacker buys 1000 PIN tokens from the manipulated pool at the market rate: 1000 * $1.42 = $1420.
6. The attacker calls purchase in PinlinkShop with `fractionsAmount` = 100 and `maxTotalPinAmount` = 1000, paying 1000 PIN.
7. The `purchase` function queries `convertFromUsd`, which uses the stale $10 price: (100 * 100) / 10 = 1000 PIN, accepting the payment as $10,000 worth.
8. The attacker receives all 100 fractions, repays the flash loan (e.g., $1420 + 0.09% fee = ~$1421.28), and retains the asset.

### Impact

The sellers suffer an approximate loss of $8578.72 in value per exploited listing. The attacker gains $8578.72 per attack cycle by acquiring 100 fractions worth $10,000 for a total cost of $1421.28. This profit can be realized by:
- Reselling the fractions at full market value once the oracle updates.
- Earning staking rewards from the acquired asset at a significant discount.

### Mitigation

To prevent this exploit, consider replacing centralized oracle with TWAP. TWAP is resistant to short-term price manipulation like flash loan attacks.
