# ERC165 Interface Support for IERC7572 in FractionalAssets Contract

### Summary

The omission of an IERC7572 check in the supportsInterface function will cause a breach in ERC165 compliance for external systems such as marketplaces and wallets, as these systems rely on accurate interface detection to interact with the token contract. This critical vulnerability disrupts protocol interoperability and could lead to irreversible integration failures in Ethereum mainnet deployments.

### Root Cause

Contract Declaration:
The FractionalAssets contract explicitly declares that it implements IERC7572:
```solidity
contract FractionalAssets is ERC1155Supply, AccessControl, IERC7572 { ... }
```
Flawed ERC165 Implementation:
The supportsInterface function omits a check for IERC7572, as illustrated below:
```solidity
function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view override(...) returns (bool) {
    return AccessControl.supportsInterface(interfaceId) || ERC1155.supportsInterface(interfaceId); // Missing IERC7572 check
}
```
Concrete Example of Failure:
When an external system, such as a marketplace, attempts to verify compliance by invoking supportsInterface(type(IERC7572).interfaceId), the function incorrectly returns false. This failure prevents the token from being listed or used in systems that depend on proper interface recognition.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Deployment: The FractionalAssets contract is deployed with the flawed supportsInterface function.

### External Pre-conditions

Integration Attempt: An external protocol (e.g., a marketplace) queries supportsInterface(type(IERC7572).interfaceId) to verify compliance.

### Attack Path

    Step 1: A user attempts to list a FractionalAssets token on a marketplace.

    Step 2: The marketplace calls supportsInterface(type(IERC7572).interfaceId) on the token contract.

    Step 3: The function returns false, causing the marketplace to reject the token as non-compliant.

### Impact

    Affected Party: Token holders and the protocol itself.

    Loss: Users cannot trade or use the token in ERC165-aware systems (e.g., marketplaces, wallets).

    Protocol Impact: Irreversible reputational and functional damage if deployed on Ethereum mainnet.

### PoC

```solidity 
// Test to verify ERC165 compliance for IERC7572
function test_SupportsIERC7572() public {
    FractionalAssets token = new FractionalAssets("uri");
    bytes4 ierc7572Id = type(IERC7572).interfaceId;
    bool isSupported = token.supportsInterface(ierc7572Id);
    assertTrue(isSupported); // ❌ Test fails due to missing check
}
```

### Mitigation

Update the supportsInterface function to include IERC7572:
```solidity


function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) public view override(...) returns (bool) {
    return 
        interfaceId == type(IERC7572).interfaceId || 
        super.supportsInterface(interfaceId); // ✅ Fixes compliance
}
```
Verification:

    Ensure type(IERC7572).interfaceId is explicitly checked.

    Use super to chain parent contract checks.
