# Unrestricted Listing Modifications in modifyListing Function

### Summary

The `PinLinkShop.sol::modifyListing` function allows the seller to indefinitely extend the deadline and repeatedly modify the price of a listing. Since there are no restrictions on the number of modifications, a seller can keep a listing active indefinitely by continuously extending the deadline. Additionally, frequent price changes could lead to market manipulation or unfair advantages. These issues could impact buyers' trust and the overall integrity of the marketplace.

### Root Cause

```solidity
   @>     if (usdPricePerFraction > 0) {
            _listings[listingId].usdPricePerFraction = usdPricePerFraction;
            emit PriceUpdated(listingId, usdPricePerFraction);
        }
   @>    if (newDeadline > 0) {
            require(newDeadline > block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());
            _listings[listingId].deadline = newDeadline;
            emit DeadlineExtended(listingId, newDeadline);
        }
```

### Impact

1. Indefinite Listing Manipulation – The seller can keep modifying the deadline, preventing listings from ever expiring. This could lead to listings that remain active indefinitely, creating an unfair marketplace and potentially misleading buyers about asset availability.

2. Market Manipulation via Price Changes – The seller can continuously adjust the price, which can be exploited to mislead buyers, manipulate price trends, or engage in bait-and-switch tactics. Buyers may think they are getting a certain deal, only for the seller to change the price at the last moment.

3.Disruption of Fair Market Dynamics – Since listings are expected to have a set deadline, allowing indefinite modifications disrupts price discovery and market efficiency. Malicious sellers could use this to hold listings open while waiting for favorable market conditions, making the system unpredictable for buyers.

4. Potential Denial of Service (DoS) on Listings – By constantly modifying a listing, a seller could prevent competitors from gaining visibility, clogging the marketplace with perpetual listings that are never actually intended to be completed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enforce a Maximum Deadline Extension – Introduce a restriction on how far into the future the deadline can be extended. For example, limit extensions to a maximum of 30 days from the current timestamp to prevent indefinite listings.

Limit the Number of Modifications – Implement a restriction on how many times a seller can modify the price and deadline. This prevents abuse while still allowing reasonable flexibility.
