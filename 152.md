# Admins can manipulate token price rapidly causing large deviations and sales price manipulation

### Summary

The function `CentralizedOracle.sol::updateTokenPrice()` has following checks to prevent large price deviations ([link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L55)):
```solidity
        if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
        if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();
```

However, these checks are not effective because admins can call this function repeatedly without any timelock between the calls. This means that admins can set token price to virtually any price with no restrictions whatsoever.

### Root Cause

The function `CentralizedOracle.sol::updateTokenPrice()` is missing timelock logic which would prevent possibility for admins to call this function repeatedly in short time period.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call function `CentralizedOracle.sol::updateTokenPrice()` repeatedly to set token price to any price he/she desires.

### External Pre-conditions

No external pre conditions

### Attack Path

1. User lists asset for sale for certain USD price
2. Admins quickly raise PIN price enormously high relative to USD
3. Admins buy users asset (from some other account) on discounted price because PIN price is inflated so conversion USD => PIN is not reflecting the real price
4. Admins set PIN price back to normal

### Impact

User selling an asset could easily lose majority of assets worth without notice because of immediate price changes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add timelock between price changes as shown in comments below:
