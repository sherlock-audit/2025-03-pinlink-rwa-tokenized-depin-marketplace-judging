# Incorrect Asset Supply Limit Check in `enableAsset`

## Description
The `enableAsset` function is responsible for initializing an asset in the `RewardsStream` struct with a specified supply and assigning it to a receiver. The function enforces constraints on `assetSupply` using the following check:

```solidity
require(assetSupply < MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh());
```

However, this condition does not prevent `assetSupply` from being exactly equal to `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY`, which may lead to unintended behavior if `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY` is meant to be the strict upper limit.

## Code Snippet:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L66

## Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability lies in the use of the `<` (less than) operator instead of `<=` (less than or equal to) in the requirement check:

```solidity
require(assetSupply < MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh());
```

### Potential Issues:
1. **Unintended asset supply allowance:** If `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY` represents an absolute limit, the current check mistakenly allows an asset supply exactly equal to this value.
2. **Inconsistency with expected constraints:** If other parts of the system assume that `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY` is an exclusive upper bound, this could lead to inconsistencies in reward calculations or system constraints.

## Impact
- **Potential breach of asset supply limits**, leading to incorrect reward calculations or system constraints being violated.
- **Inconsistent behavior** if other functions treat `MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY` as an exclusive limit.

## Mitigation
To enforce a strict upper limit on `assetSupply`, the condition should be updated as follows:

```solidity
require(assetSupply <= MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY, PinlinkRewards_AssetSupplyTooHigh());
```
