# Mis-scaled Delta Calculation in depositRewards Function may give users rewards in 1e18 instead of 1e6(USDC)

### Summary

In `streams::depositRewards` function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L87C4-L106C6 

`delta` is used on this functionas a scaled-per-asset indicator for how much reward each unit of asset accrues, which is basically an reward distribution mechanism.

This `delta` is calculated, then is added to `globalRewardsPerStakedTarget` that tracks the reward “rate” per unit of asset for all stakers (global accumulator).

Later, when a user claims their rewards using the `pinlinkShop::claimRewards` or `pinlinkShop::claimRewardsMultiple`, the accumulated `delta` that has been "earned" by their staked balance is multiplied by `PRECISION` and then divided by  `self.assetSupply`

It calculates delta value like this:
 ```solidity 
uint256 delta = (amount * PRECISION) / self.assetSupply; 
``` 
With a `PRECISION` value set to be 1e18 and a `self.assetSupply` that is enforced to be < 1e4 in order to enable asset by using `streams::enableAsset` , and an deposit of any `amount` > 1e6 since it does a if statement on `depositRewards` function(Explained on root cause)

This implies that the `delta` is way larger than what was supposed to give, it will be way more than 1e6, it could be 1e18 depending on calculation(See POC). When the rewards distribution expected intended scale was to operate at `1e6`.

Thus, It affects the rewards system as a whole, for the protocol economic state and also by giving any staker an bigger reward amount when they claim it. 

### Root Cause

The mis-scaling arises from multiplying the 

The `amount` can be anything the `OPERATOR_ROLE` wants but it has to be > 1e6 because of if statements on `depositRewards`function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L95

by `PRECISION` set at 1e18 by the protocol:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L41

and then dividing by an `self.assetSupply `that is relatively low (1e4 because of require statements in `enableAsset` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L64C5-L72C6

And it sets(on the function):
```solidity
self.assetSupply = assetSupply;
```
Which is why on delta the `self.assetSupply` will be < 1e4.

This results in a delta value that gives decimals of magnitude larger than anticipated, leading to potential inaccuracies if the internal calculations were expected to give rewards was to operate on a 1e6 scale(USDC).

### Internal Pre-conditions

- During asset enabling (`enableAsset`), the contract enforces that the supplied `assetSupply` is less than MAX_ASSET_SUPPLY (<=1e4).
- The `streams::depositRewards` function uses this small `assetSupply` in the `delta` calculation, directly influencing the scaling factor.
- `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` must call `pinLinkShop::enableAsset` 
- The `pinlinkShop::depositRewards` must be called by the `OPERATOR_ROLE` and the function must be calling `stream.depositRewards`

### External Pre-conditions

- User need to have passed through the protocol main functionalities in order to be an stakeholder, like listing and purchase functions. 
- Stakeholders and users expect reward distributions to be accurately and fairly computed based on their staked assets so they need to claim their rewards by calling `claimRewards` or `claimRewardsMultiple`
- The protocol's overall tokenomics are designed with the assumption of proper scaling in rewards: giving decimals of 1e6 because of USDC; any deviation could affect reward allocations.

### Attack Path

1. The contract `OPERATOR_ROLE` calls `pinLinkShop::depositRewards` with a reward amount, typically on a scale of 1e6
2. The `delta` is computed as (amount * PRECISION) / self.assetSupply.
3. With assetSupply being a small number (< 1e4), the resultant delta will be larger than expected
4. When rewards are later distributed to users/stakeholders, the inflated delta could lead to overestimated claimable rewards.

### Impact

- Excessively high reward distribution.
- The protocol may distribute significantly more rewards than intended, disrupting the tokenomics and diluting the token value, leading to possibly token inflation overtime.
- Also, stakeholders might earn way more than planned, but they would had been taken the advantage from the protocol, since they would receive rewards with larger magnitude, leading to more incentive to stake, but economic loss for the protocol.

### PoC

- **Example Calculation:**  

```solidity
uint256 delta = (amount * PRECISION) / self.assetSupply;
```
  For a reward deposit of `amount = 1e6` and `PRECISION = 1e18`:

  ```solidity
  delta = (1e6 * 1e18) / self.assetSupply
```

Since `assetSupply < 1e4`, then:

```solidity
  delta ≈ (1e24) / (1e3) = 1e18
```
Leading to larger magnitudes, if the protocol was intended to give rewards at an scale of 1e6(USDC decimals), then this would be 12 times of magnitude larger than expected


### Mitigation

Ensure that subsequent calculations which consume `delta` (e.g., reward claim processing) correctly compensate for the excess scaling.
You can divide the result by of the multiplication by `PRECISION` in which normalizes the amount.

```solidity
uint256 delta = (amount * PRECISION) / PRECISION;
```
