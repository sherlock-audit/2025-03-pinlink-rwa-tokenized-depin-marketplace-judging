# Unauthorized Deadline Reduction in the modifyListing function

### Summary

The missing check in `modifylisting` function enables sellers to reduce a listing’s deadline to a time earlier than originally set, effectively allowing them to cancel listings prematurely. Such behavior is contrary to the intended design in  `emit DeadlineExtended(listingId, newDeadline);`

### Root Cause

In `pinlinkShop.sol:278` There is a missing check in `modifyListing` Function that requires that a new deadline that it is not earlier than the existing listing deadline.
This missing check allows sellers to intentionally reduce the deadline at any time, regardless of the buyer’s expectations or the original terms of the listing.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1  Listing Initialization:
A listing is created with a specified deadline (e.g., 5 PM) and other parameters like price and token details.
2  Seller Authorization:
The `onlySeller` modifier correctly restricts modifications to the listing creator, ensuring only the seller can modify the listing.
3  Deadline Check:
The function currently checks that the new deadline is greater than the current block timestamp. It does not compare the new deadline with the existing one, thereby allowing a reduction.
4  Event Emission Misnomer:
The event `DeadlineExtended` is emitted regardless of whether the deadline is actually extended or shortened, potentially obscuring the real change.


### External Pre-conditions

1. Buyer Expectations:
Buyers operate under the assumption that the listing deadline is final or subject only to extensions. They plan their purchase decisions based on the advertised deadline.

### Attack Path


1	A seller creates a listing with a deadline of 5 PM.
2	Buyers observe the listing and plan their purchase decisions based on the given deadline.
3	Prior to the planned purchase window (for example, at 4 PM), the seller invokes the `modifyListing` function with a new deadline set to 2 PM.
4	The function, after validating that the new deadline is greater than the current block timestamp, updates the listing’s deadline without checking against the existing deadline.
  Buyer Impact:
5	Buyers expecting the listing to remain active until 5 PM find the listing expired at 2 PM.
6	The seller can use this tactic to cancel listings early or avoid executing a sale under unfavorable conditions.
•  Repeated Abuse:
7	If performed repeatedly, the seller may manipulate market conditions, relisting assets at more advantageous terms while misleading multiple buyers.


### Impact

Sellers can exploit the vulnerability to cancel listings strategically, potentially skewing market supply and pricing dynamics.

### PoC


A seller creates a listing with the following parameters:
Deadline: 5 PM (timestamp: T₅)
Price: Fixed USD price per fraction
Listing ID: Derived from listing parameters
	Exploit Execution:
At 4 PM (timestamp T₄, where T₄ < T₅), the seller executes:

      modifyListing(listingId, 0, newDeadline);

where `newDeadline` is set to 2 PM (timestamp: T₂, with T₂ > block.timestamp but T₂ < T₅).

The function performs the following:
Checks: `if (newDeadline > block.timestamp)` passes (since T₂ > T₄).
Updates: `_listings[listingId].deadline = newDeadline;`
The listing’s deadline is now T₂.
Event: `Emits DeadlineExtended(listingId, newDeadline)` despite the fact that the deadline was shortened.
	Result:
Buyers who planned to act based on the original 5 PM deadline are now unable to purchase the asset as the listing has been prematurely closed at 2 PM.


### Mitigation

Update the `modifyListing` function to require that the new deadline is not earlier than the current deadline.

        if (newDeadline > 0) {
              // Ensure the new deadline is not earlier than the existing deadline
         ✅  require(newDeadline >= _listings[listingId].deadline, "Deadline can only be extended");
              require(newDeadline > block.timestamp, DeadlineHasExpiredAlready());
              _listings[listingId].deadline = newDeadline;
              emit DeadlineExtended(listingId, newDeadline);
          }
