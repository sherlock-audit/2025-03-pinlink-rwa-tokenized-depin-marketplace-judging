# Fund Lockup Risk

### Summary

The contract contains a rescue function that allows admins to withdraw tokens:

function rescueToken(address erc20Token, address to) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    if (erc20Token == address(REWARDS_TOKEN)) revert InvalidParameter();
    
    // PIN is not expected to stay in this contract balance, so it is ok to recover
    IERC20(erc20Token).safeTransfer(to, IERC20(erc20Token).balanceOf(address(this)));
}
The Problem

Selective Token Recovery: The function specifically prevents rescuing the REWARDS_TOKEN (USDC), but allows rescuing other tokens, including PIN.
Accounting Mismatch: The comment states "PIN is not expected to stay in this contract balance," but this assumes perfect execution. In reality, there could be PIN tokens in the contract for legitimate reasons:

In-flight transactions that haven't been fully processed
Temporary holdings as part of marketplace operations
User deposits that haven't been accounted for yet

No Balance Reconciliation: The function transfers the entire balance of the specified token without checking against any internal accounting. It has no way to differentiate between:

PIN tokens that are legitimately part of the system's operations
PIN tokens that were accidentally sent to the contract

Potential for Theft: If the contract legitimately holds PIN tokens as part of its operations, an admin could use this function to extract those tokens, potentially stealing them from users.

Example Scenario

User A initiates a complex transaction involving PIN tokens
The transaction is partially processed, with some PIN tokens temporarily held by the contract
Before the transaction completes, an admin calls rescueToken(PIN_ADDRESS, adminWallet)
All PIN tokens in the contract, including those belonging to User A, are transferred to the admin
User A's transaction eventually fails or completes incorrectly, and their funds are lost

### Mitigation

Track Token Balances: Maintain internal accounting of all tokens that should be in the contract.

Calculate Excess Only: Only allow rescuing the difference between actual balance and expected balance

Time Locks: Implement a time delay for rescue operations to prevent quick theft
Emergency Procedures: Have clear procedures for when funds need to be rescued


function rescueToken(address erc20Token, address to) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    if (erc20Token == address(REWARDS_TOKEN)) revert InvalidParameter();
    
    uint256 actualBalance = IERC20(erc20Token).balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 expectedBalance = getExpectedBalance(erc20Token); // Would need to implement this
    
    uint256 excessBalance = actualBalance > expectedBalance ? actualBalance - expectedBalance : 0;
    
    require(excessBalance > 0, "No excess balance to rescue");
    IERC20(erc20Token).safeTransfer(to, excessBalance);
}
