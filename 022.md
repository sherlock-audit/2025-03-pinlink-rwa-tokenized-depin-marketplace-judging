# Severe Reentrancy in withdrawAsset: Attackers Can Steal All Assets

### Summary

The missing reentrancy protection in `pinlinkShop.sol` will cause a complete loss of funds for users as an attacker will repeatedly call `withdrawAsset` before state updates, draining the contract.

### Root Cause

In `pinlinkShop.sol`, the `withdrawAsset` and `_deposit` functions make external calls before updating the contract state, allowing reentrancy attacks.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The attacker must deposit assets into `pinlinkShop`.
2. The attacker must have a fallback function capable of re-entering `withdrawAsset`.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The protocol must allow withdrawals without proper reentrancy protection.
2. The external token contract must execute transfers without blocking reentrant calls.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker deposits assets into `pinlinkShop`.
2. The attacker calls `withdrawAsset`, triggering an external call before the state update.
3. The attack contract’s fallback function re-enters `withdrawAsset` before the first call finalizes.
4. The attacker drains all assets by repeating this process.

### Impact

1. The protocol suffers a complete loss of user funds due to reentrancy.
2. The attacker gains unauthorized asset withdrawals, draining the contract’s balance.

        pinlinkShop = new PinlinkShop();
        fractionalAssets = IFractionalAssets(address(pinlinkShop));
        attacker = address(this);
        vm.deal(attacker, 10 ether);

        if (!attackTriggered) {
            attackTriggered = true;
            pinlinkShop.withdrawAsset(1, 100); // Re-enter function before state updates
        }
    }

    function testReentrancyAttack() public {
        pinlinkShop.depositAsset(1, 100);
        pinlinkShop.withdrawAsset(1, 100); // Initial call triggers reentrant exploit

        // Check if the attack was successful
        assertGt(attacker.balance, 10 ether, "Reentrancy attack failed");
    }
}

### Mitigation

1. Use Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern: Ensure that state updates happen before external calls.
2. Implement OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard on vulnerable functions to block reentrant calls.
3. Limit external calls in withdraw functions, ensuring no unintended side effects.
