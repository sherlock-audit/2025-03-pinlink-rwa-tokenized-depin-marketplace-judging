# simulateDepositRewards.sol-- Hardcoded reward configuration and centralized reward allocation exposes system to operational risk

### Summary

The `simulateDepositRewards.sol` script hardcodes contract addresses (Lines 9–12) 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/pinlinkshop/simulateDepositRewards.sol#L9-L12

and reward configurations (Lines 18–27),

including token approvals and `depositRewards()` logic. This creates a high-risk deployment bottleneck where human error, misconfiguration, or centralized control can lead to improper fund allocations or failed reward deposits.





### Root Cause

 • Lines 9–112:
Hardcoded addresses for USDCmock, PIN, pshop, and fractionalAssets instead of using environment variables or dynamic deployment input.
 • Lines 18–27:
Reward deposits are manually and statically configured, lacking dynamic runtime checks or validation logic for asset IDs, reward amounts, or timeframes.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Developer runs the script on a different network without updating the hardcoded contract addresses.
2. Incorrect token IDs or reward amounts are set manually.
3. No internal validation for reward token liquidity, duration limits, or token compatibility.



### External Pre-conditions

1. Reward token (USDCmock) is not deployed or doesn’t match ERC20 behavior on a new chain.
2. External dependency like pshop behaves differently across chains or is not synced.
3. Project deploys the script in production environments without secondary review or automation.



### Attack Path

1. Script is executed without modifying addresses in Lines 9–12.
2. `approve()` or `depositRewards()` logic either fails silently or allocates funds incorrectly.
3. Rewards may be sent to unintended pools or go unrecoverable if token ID mismatches occur.



### Impact

• Reward emissions misconfigured or skipped entirely.
• Users receive no rewards or incorrect allocations.
• Loss of trust due to flawed distribution logic.

// Commented-out lines suggest inconsistent reward config and developer uncertainty


### Mitigation

• Replace hardcoded addresses with `vm.envAddress("CONTRACT_NAME")` injection.
• Create modular config files or use structured `rewardPlans[]` instead of manual `depositRewards()` calls.
• Add a pre-check step to validate token compatibility, balance, and existing reward configurations before execution.
