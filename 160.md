# ### [M-1] setOracle checks that price is higher than 1e6 to avoid invalid Oracle Prices, however normal token/market conditions might cause the price to drop below that threshold, causing the transaction to revert and making it impossible to change the oracle

### Summary

**Description:** 
The `pinlinkShop` contract contains the following `setOracle` function:
<details>
<summary>function</summary>

```javascript
   function setOracle(address oracle_) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        require(IPinlinkOracle(oracle_).supportsInterface(type(IPinlinkOracle).interfaceId), InvalidOracleInterface());

        // a stale oracle will return 0. Potentially this also validates the oracle has at least 18dp
        uint256 testValue = IPinlinkOracle(oracle_).convertToUsd(PIN, 1e18);
        if (testValue < 1e6) revert InvalidOraclePrice();

        emit OracleSet(oracle_);
        oracle = oracle_;
    }

```
</details>

Which before changing the oracle address, tests whether the price is higher than `1e6`, to assert that the number of decimal points is correct.
The PIN token has 18 decimals, being then 1e6 an expression such as: `0.000000000001000000`
Then, with `1 usd ~ 1000000000000`  PIN tokens, the transaction reverts
While such a price is not expected, and a scenario in which it happens is really undesired, it would also make it impossible to change the oracle for a better solution.
This scenario is highly unlikely, but the importance of the oracle change is also high.

### Root Cause

This check isn't specific enough

```javascript
        uint256 testValue = IPinlinkOracle(oracle_).convertToUsd(PIN, 1e18);
        if (testValue < 1e6) revert InvalidOraclePrice();

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The setOracle performs that check on the value

### External Pre-conditions

1. the price of `PIN` drops below `0.000000000001000000`

### Attack Path

1. The contract is deployed
2. the price of `PIN` drops below `0.000000000001000000`
3. `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` calls the setOracle function
4. The function reverts with `if (testValue < 1e6) revert InvalidOraclePrice();`

### Impact

If this unlikely scenario happened, the oracle wouldn't be able to change, and the protocol as a whole would remain exposed to the risk of a single point of failure for pricefeeds for an indeterminate lapse of time.

### PoC

1. The contract is deployed
2. the price of `PIN` drops below `0.000000000001000000`
3. The oracle would be unchangeable until the price rises above that threshold

### Mitigation

Some possible measures could be:

- Adding two more arguments, for an `expectedPrice` and a `variabilityRange`, to replace that check with one asserting that the price given is within `expectedPrice + variabilityRange || expectedPrice - variabilityRange`

- Making the protocol pausable to avoid any issue during the oracle change, and removing that check

- or using a different oracle from the outset, which as a protocol you already weighted
