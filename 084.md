# Reward Calculation Logic Flaw in Delisting Mechanism

### Summary

A critical vulnerability exists in the delist function where delisting assets does not properly update the reward calculation parameters. Attackers can exploit this flaw to illegitimately accumulate rewards from the rewards pool even after delisting their assets, leading to unfair reward distribution and potential fund drainage.

### Root Cause

Technical Analysis:

The delist function decreases _listedBalances but does not update stakedBalances in the reward stream.
The reward calculation system uses stakedBalances to determine reward shares, allowing delisted assets to continue accumulating rewards.
```solidity
// PinlinkShop.sol - delist() function  
_listedBalances[listing.fractionalAssets][listing.tokenId][seller] -= amount;  
// Missing: Reward balance adjustment for stakedBalances  
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

Asset State:

The target asset (fractionalAssets, tokenId) must be enabled via enableAsset.
The attacker must have an active listing created via list().
​Contract State:

streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].isEnabled() == true.
_listedBalances[fractionalAssets][tokenId][attacker] > 0.

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Phase 1 - Setup:

Attacker deposits assets via depositAsset() → increases stakedBalances.
Attacker creates a listing via list() → increases _listedBalances.
​Phase 2 - Reward Accrual:

Rewards are distributed proportionally to stakedBalances via the reward stream.
​Phase 3 - Malicious Delisting:

Attacker calls delist() to remove the listing:
```solidity
_listedBalances[...] -= amount;  // Listed balance decreases  
// stakedBalances[...] remains unchanged ❌  
```
stakedBalances retains the original value, allowing continued reward accumulation.

Phase 4 - Cyclic Abuse:

Attacker repeatedly:
Creates new listings (list())
Immediately delists them (delist())
Maintains high stakedBalances to siphon rewards despite not actively participating in the marketplace.

### Impact

Rewards pool drained due to illegitimate allocations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement state consistency checks between _listedBalances and stakedBalances.
Add event logging for stakedBalances changes during delisting.
Introduce a time-lock mechanism to prevent rapid listing/delisting cycles.
