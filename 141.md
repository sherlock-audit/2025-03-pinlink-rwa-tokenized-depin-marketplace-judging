# The sanity check in `updateTokenPrice` could leave the oracle price stuck at an inaccurate/higher-than-market rate price

### Summary

The sanity check implemented in `updateTokenPrice` in `CentralisedOracle.sol` could prevent the owner from updating the actual current market price of the token as it checks if the `usdPerToken` price to be updated is less than `_currentPrice / 5` and if it is greater than `_currentPrice * 5` which could actually occur in case of crypto market crash ( or the token's price crash) and crypto market surge (or the token's price surge) respectively.

### Root Cause

In `CentralisedOracle.sol:56` and `CentralisedOracle.sol:57`, in a scenario where the token price falls or pumps drastically reaching 1/5 or x5 of the previous price in the oracle, the owner would not be able to update the price of the token leaving the oracle stuck with an inaccurate, stale token price.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `_tokenPriceInUsd` needs to have been set in the constructor

### External Pre-conditions

1. Token price falls to 1/5 of the previous price set by the owner
2. Token price rises to x5 of the previous price set by the owner


### Attack Path

Owner calls updateTokenPrice with `usdPerToken` <=` _currentPrice / 5` or >= `_currentPrice * 5`

### Impact

The protocol users are left with an inaccurate token price which could result in them paying more or less than they should purchasing fractional assets.
