# The oracle will allow buyers to exploit outdated prices for fractional assets.

### Summary

The check in the function [`updateTokenPrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L57):
```solidity
if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();
```
will cause a significant financial loss for sellers as the oracle will provide outdated lower prices for fractional assets in some cases.

### Root Cause

In `CentralizedOracle.sol`, the lack of a mechanism to update the price when it increases by more than 500% allows buyers to exploit outdated prices.

- In `CentralizedOracle.sol:57`, the check for price increases is insufficient, allowing the price to remain outdated. As this is only callable by admin (bot), it should be trusted enough.

As the sponsors have stated in the README there would be a bot updating the price every X minutes (X would be chosen later). However, this price cannot be updated if it goes up by more than 500 % in the span of X minutes and the functions that use this price would use the old price. 

As it seems impossible for the price to go up sharply, there have been examples of such scenarios in the past, especially for tokens that are not that expensive. The current price of the PIN token is around 0,66 $. We can see the price of the token is really volatile, so it can go up and down a lot. 

This is just an example, but It would be possible for the token to go back to 0,1 $ and then to more than 0,5 $.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There should be listings in `pinlinkShop.sol`

### External Pre-conditions

1. The pair USD/PIN should go up by more than 500 % in the span of a few minutes

### Attack Path

1. Buyer sees that the price went by more than 500 % in the span of a few minutes
2. Buyer purchases a listing on the lower price, as the price cannot be updated

### Impact

The sellers suffer a loss of the difference between the market price and the outdated price the buyers paid. The attacker gains the profit from exploiting the outdated price.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Remove the following check, as the function is only callable by the admin and they are trusted.

```solidity
if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();
```
