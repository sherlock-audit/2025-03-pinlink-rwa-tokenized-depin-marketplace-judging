# An malicious user can steal listed tokens by just paying recipient fee via leveraging the `_nonListedBalance` functionality.

### Summary

An malicious user can steal fractionalAssets by listing an offer and purchasing that offer by himself.

The users can list upto the total asset he has deposit. However in the list function the user `_listedBalances` gets updated based on the input and the `stakedBalances` remains same as he deposited initially. Let's say malicious user lists all the deposited tokens.

```solidity

*Purchase function*:
        {
            // to prevent stack too deep
            uint256 listedAmount = listing.amount;
            if (listedAmount < fractionsAmount) revert NotEnoughTokens();
            // update listing information in storage
            listing.amount = listedAmount - fractionsAmount;
>>>            _listedBalances[fractionalAssets][tokenId][seller] -= fractionsAmount;

>>>            streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(seller, msg.sender, fractionsAmount);
        }
```

When the malicious user purchases some `fractionalAsset` from his own above offer, then the first `_listedBalances` gets decremented based on the malicious user's input, however the `stakedBalances` remains same since `from` and `to` were same user.

```solidity
    function transferBalances(RewardsStream storage self, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        self.updateRewards(from);
        self.updateRewards(to);
>>>        self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount;
>>>        self.stakedBalances[to] += amount;
    }
```

Now the attacker tries to list again, in which he gets succeed because the attacker's `_listedBalances` were less then `stakedBalances`.
```solidity
*_list function*:

   if (amount > _nonListedBalance(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender)) revert NotEnoughUnlistedTokens();
```

```solidity
    function _nonListedBalance(address fractionalAssets, uint256 tokenId, address account)
        internal
        view
        returns (uint256)
    {
>>>        uint256 accountBalance = streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].stakedBalances[account];
>>>        uint256 listedBalance = _listedBalances[fractionalAssets][tokenId][account];

>>>        return (accountBalance > listedBalance) ? accountBalance - listedBalance : 0;
    }
```

The malicious user lists exactly same amount which is delta between `accountBalance - listedBalance` is, which increment his `_listedBalances` again.

```solidity
        _listedBalances[fractionalAssets][tokenId][msg.sender] += amount;
```


### Root Cause

The malicious user were able to leverage the `_nonListedBalance` functionality and he created difference between his `stakedBalances` and the `listedBalance` for stealling `fractionalAssets` by purchasing his own listed offer.

The attacker were able purchase from his own listed offer.

### Internal Pre-conditions

User needs to list and then purchase his own offer.

### External Pre-conditions

I think, malicious user will also needs to approve/etc pin tokens to himself , in order to purchase from his own listed offer, because there we use `safeTransferFrom` method , so that malicious user will successfully transfer to himself.

### Attack Path

Malicious user will create the difference between the `stakedBalances` and `listedBalance`  by purchasing his own listed offer.

### Impact

The malicious user can list more tokens than how much he has deposited initially by just paying the recipient fee.
The malicious user can steal `fractionalAssets` by doing above scenario again and again.

### PoC

*Let's just consider a scenario*:

1) User deposit 100 tokens , and lists those 100 tokens.
2) User purchases 50 token from his listed offer, now the `_listedBalance` = 50 , where `stakedBalance` = 100 (same).
3) Note user gives the pin tokens for that purchase, so user just pays the fee, However the pin amount is received by that user himself. So only loss here is just a fee.
4) Now the user calls the list function again, unfortunately user `stakedBalance` were greater than `_listedBalances`  due to user purchasing his own offer which is mentioned at (2). So user can list delta of `stakedBalances` and `_listedBalance` = `(100 - 50) = 50`.
5) So the user lists those delta tokens which is 50.
6) Now the user `listedBalance` will be = 50 +50 = 100.

Typically, user deposited 100 tokens initially, but in present user still have 100 listed token , where the 50 tokens user has already been purchased. 

So in this attack user just pays the fee during purchase, but the overall this malicious user is the owner of 150 tokens in present (100 listed + 50 purchased) , where in reality he only deposited 100 tokens.

### Mitigation

If `from` and `to` is same just reduce the any one's balance here.
```solidity
 function transferBalances(RewardsStream storage self, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        self.updateRewards(from);
        self.updateRewards(to);
        self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount;
        self.stakedBalances[to] += amount;
    }
```
