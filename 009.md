# streams.sol-- Rewards Streaming System Leaks Residual Rewards on Small Asset Supply – Causes Undetectable Reward Dilution

### Summary

The rewards distribution logic in the `StreamHandler` library is prone to residual reward loss and rounding errors, particularly when asset supply is low (e.g., 1–10). The current implementation does not track unallocated residual rewards that result from integer division in line 100: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L100

`uint256 delta = (amount * PRECISION) / self.assetSupply;`

Since Solidity truncates division results, small remainder amounts are effectively lost. While the comment suggests this is “less than 1 cent per deposit”, the protocol lacks any accounting mechanism for these losses. Over time, this leads to reward leakage, which can accumulate and reduce user trust in fairness of distributions — especially under repeated deposits with low reward amounts or low supply assets.


### Root Cause

Line 100: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L100

`uint256 delta = (amount * PRECISION) / self.assetSupply;`

 • Rounding errors are introduced here with no tracking of the remainder.
 • These errors persist every `depositRewards()` call and become amplified in low-supply assets.

No Compensation Tracking Mechanism

There is no mechanism to track or reassign lost residuals, meaning protocol loses this permanently unless handled externally.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Asset is enabled and supply is within allowed range.
2. Multiple consecutive deposits occur on same asset.



### External Pre-conditions

1. Asset has low supply (e.g., 1–10 fractions).
2. Small deposit amounts (e.g., ~1 USDC minimum) used regularly.
3. Users assume accurate drip-based streaming but rewards aren’t perfectly distributed.


### Attack Path

This isn’t a direct exploit path but rather a gradual economic degradation:
1. Operator deposits 1 USDC on a 1-supply asset → full delta expected.
2. Operator deposits again — rounding error drops 0.00001 USDC each time.
3. No one can reclaim this residual unless entire reward logic is rewritten.
4. Cumulative reward leak over hundreds of assets and deposits.



### Impact

• Invisible reward loss causes underperformance for long-term stakers.
• Loss of trust in accounting precision in high-volume protocols.
• No way to reclaim lost portions, leading to economic inefficiency.
• Makes protocol look inaccurate or careless under close financial audits.



### PoC

`// Simulated low supply + low reward deposit
stream.enableAsset(1, receiver); // supply = 1
stream.depositRewards(1000001, 7 days); // should stream 1.000001 USDC`

`// Resulting delta = 1000001e18 / 1 = 1000001e18
// But Solidity math drops small portions for larger supply, if supply = 3:
delta = 1000001e18 / 3 = 333333666666666666e18 → remainder lost`

No remainder is tracked or reassigned in internal storage.



### Mitigation

• Introduce a residual accounting system:

`uint256 remainder = (amount * PRECISION) % self.assetSupply;
// store remainder in a per-asset field, add to next deposit`

 • Alternatively, buffer the unassigned portion and carry it over to next deposit using a `residualRewardsBuffer`.
 • At minimum, emit log of lost precision per deposit so protocols can externally track it:

`event RewardsResidualLost(address asset, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount);`
