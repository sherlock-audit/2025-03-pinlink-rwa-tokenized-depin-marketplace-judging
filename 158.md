# Incorrect accounting of `Fees` in `pinlinkShop::purchase()`

## Summary: 

A buyer is able to receive more fractional assets than they paid for. This issue occurs because we transfer the full `fractionsAmount` to the buyer, but we don't account for fees while doing so. 

Therefore, the user is sent the whole amount of fractional asset. So, indirectly, the burden of fee falls on the seller instead of the buyer. 


## Description: 

Buyers can purchase fractional assets via `purchase()` function. To do so, they are required to pay in PIN tokens. 
During this process, the Fractional amount is converted to PIN tokens via oracle. 

Observe this portion of the function
[#purchase()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L288-L303)
```solidity 

// update listing information in storage
            listing.amount = listedAmount - fractionsAmount;
            _listedBalances[fractionalAssets][tokenId][seller] -= fractionsAmount;

            streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(seller, msg.sender, fractionsAmount);
        }

        uint256 totalUsdPayment = listing.usdPricePerFraction * fractionsAmount;
        uint256 totalPinPayment = IPinlinkOracle(oracle).convertFromUsd(address(PIN), totalUsdPayment);

        if (totalPinPayment == 0) revert StaleOraclePrice();
        if (totalPinPayment > maxTotalPinAmount) revert SlippageExceeded();

        // transfers the payment to the seller and the fees to the feeReceiver
        // note: ERC20 with callbacks (ERC777) are not supported, so the following should be safe
        (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees) = _handlePayments(msg.sender, seller, totalPinPayment);
```

Notice that the whole `fractionsAmount` is sent to the `msg.sender`
```solidity
Â streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(seller, msg.sender, fractionsAmount);
```

However, we didn't account for fees here. 

Then this `fractionsAmount` is converted into PIN tokens and then in `_handlePayments()`, it's split into `fees` and `paymentForSeller`. 

So, even though the buyer pays the fees, but he still gets the full amount of fractional asset. 
Hence, indirectly, the burden of fees falls on the seller. 

This results in the seller receiving less than the expected value for their assets, as the fee is deducted from the payment without adjusting the asset amount

## Impact: 

For each buy, the seller receives less amount than the true value of their asset. 
If the fee is 10%, then seller will lose 10% on each sale. This should discourage the seller from listing their asset for sale. 


## Recommendation: 

Consider adjusting the `fractionsAmount`:
```solidity 

uint256 adjustedFractionAmount = (fractionsAmount * purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
// Use this to make state changes to listings etc. 

if (listedAmount < adjustedFractionAmount) revert NotEnoughTokens();

// update listing information in storage
listing.amount = listedAmount - adjustedFractionAmount;

_listedBalances[fractionalAssets][tokenId][seller] -= adjustedFractionAmount;

streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(seller, msg.sender, adjustedFractionAmount);

// From here, we use the full fractionsAmount  i.e. 

 uint256 totalUsdPayment = listing.usdPricePerFraction * fractionsAmount;
uint256 totalPinPayment = IPinlinkOracle(oracle).convertFromUsd(address(PIN), totalUsdPayment);

if (totalPinPayment == 0) revert StaleOraclePrice();
if (totalPinPayment > maxTotalPinAmount) revert SlippageExceeded();

(uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees) = _handlePayments(msg.sender, seller, totalPinPayment);

```
