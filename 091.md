# Possibility of griefing users withdrawer via front-running

### Summary

Front running can disrupt users action when they try to withdraw asset from the protocol as a result of calling `withdrawAsset` 

### Root Cause

In `pinlinkShop.sol:354`, the `withdrawasset` function can be front-run with a manipulated amount.

If an attacker frontruns the transaction and increases the amount to a value higher than the victim's available balance, the victim's transaction could fail with `NotEnoughUnlistedTokens()`. This would waste gas for the victim (user) and potentially cause denial of service (DoS) for future attempts.
Another issue this might cause is that, it can lead to draining of funds or stopping withdrawals. If the attacker can force consistent reverts on the protocol, they could lock up funds in the contract by ensuring that no withdrawals are ever successful. Even though funds wouldnâ€™t be directly stolen, the contract could become unusable due to constant failures.

### Internal Pre-conditions

none

### External Pre-conditions

- The user needs to withdraw assets from the protocol by calling `withdrawAsset` function.

### Attack Path

## How It Works:
1. The victim submits a transaction:
- withdrawAsset(fractionalAssets, tokenId, amount, receiver)
2. The attacker detects the transaction in the mempool.
3. The attacker frontruns the transaction with a higher gas fee and:
- calls `withdrawAsset` with an increased amount to cause the victim's call to revert.
4. The victim's transaction fails with NotEnoughUnlistedTokens():
- Gas is wasted.
- The victim might not be able to withdraw due to repeated failures.

## Why it Works:
- The attack works because the withdrawAsset function doesn't lock the amount to the transaction sender.
- The attacker can manipulate the amount and frontrun the transaction to make sure the victim's withdrawal fails.
- Even though funds are not stolen, this is a `griefing` attack because it wastes gas and makes the contract unusable.

### Impact

## This could cause

- Denial of Service (DoS): The attacker can consistently frontrun withdrawal attempts, causing them to revert due to the NotEnoughUnlistedTokens() check, and this could result in a complete lockup of funds because the contract state will remain unchanged. Legitimate users would be unable to withdraw their assets; essentially, the contract becomes unusable until the attack stops or the contract is upgraded or fixed.

- Gas Drain and Cost to Victims: Every failed transaction still costs gas for the victim. The attacker could spam the mempool and create consistent failed transactions, thereby making the victims waste significant amounts of gas trying to withdraw, and this might lead to increased network congestion and higher gas fees for other users on the network.

### PoC

```solidity

 function test_withdrawAsset() public {
        uint256 withdrawAmount = 5;
        uint256 balanceBefore = fractions.balanceOf(alice, asset1);
        // Attacker frontruns with higher gas 
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        pshop.withdrawAsset(address(fractions), asset1, 11, alice);
        vm.stopPrank();

        //Original withdrawer of the user now fails as a result of griefing
        vm.prank(alice);
        pshop.withdrawAsset(address(fractions), asset1, withdrawAmount, alice);
        console.log("fractions: ",fractions.balanceOf(alice, asset1));
        console.log("balanceBefore: ", balanceBefore + withdrawAmount);
        assertEq(fractions.balanceOf(alice, asset1), balanceBefore + withdrawAmount);
    }


```

### Mitigation

## Potential Fixes:

- Use a commit-reveal pattern: First, have the user commit to the amount and the receiver. Only allow withdrawal after the commitment period. 
- Limit gas fees: Add gas fee limits to prevent frontrunning with excessive gas.
- Use a nonce or deadline: Include a nonce or block timestamp check to prevent mempool manipulation.
- Verify the receiver address: Require the receiver to be the transaction sender or a pre-approved address.
