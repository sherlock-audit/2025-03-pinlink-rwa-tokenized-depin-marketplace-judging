# Admin will extract assets from all users This title concisely captures

### Summary

The excessive permissions granted to DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE will cause a critical impact for all users as the admin can extract user assets through the rescueToken function.
Detailed explanation:
1. root cause: The excessive permissions granted to DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE
- Cause: DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE is granted excessive permissions to extract any tokens (except REWARDS_TOKEN) from the contract
2. impact: critical impact
- Impact: Critical level, as it may result in user asset loss
3. affected party: all users
- Affected: All users, as their staked assets and payment tokens could be extracted
4. actor: the admin
- Actor: The administrator (holder of DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE)
5. attack path: extract user assets through the rescueToken function
- Path: Through the rescueToken function to extract user assets

### Root Cause

In pinlinkShop.sol: the rescueToken function grants excessive permissions to DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to extract any tokens (except REWARDS_TOKEN) from the contract, violating the principle of least privilege.
Detailed explanation:
1. This is a code-level error because:
- The implementation of the rescueToken function in [pinlinkShop.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L379) is problematic
- The function grants excessive permissions to DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE
- It violates the principle of least privilege
2. Specific issues:
- The function only restricts extraction of REWARDS_TOKEN
- Allows extraction of user staked assets
- Allows extraction of user payment tokens (PIN)
- Allows extraction of any other tokens accidentally sent to the contract
3.Why this is wrong:
- Administrators should not have permission to extract user assets
- Violates the principle of least privilege
- Increases attack surface
- May result in user asset loss


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE needs to be granted to an address to enable token extraction
2. The contract needs to hold any tokens (except REWARDS_TOKEN) to be extracted
3. The DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE holder needs to call rescueToken() with:
- A valid ERC20 token address (not REWARDS_TOKEN)
- A valid recipient address
4. The DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE holder needs to have sufficient gas to execute the transaction
Detailed explanation:
1. First condition establishes the attacker's capability
2. Second condition ensures there are tokens to extract
3. Third condition specifies the required parameters for the attack
4. Fourth condition ensures the attack can be executed

### External Pre-conditions

1. Users need to have deposited or staked assets in the PinlinkShop contract
2. Users need to have made payments in PIN tokens to the contract
3. The contract needs to have received any other ERC20 tokens from external sources
4. The DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE holder's private key needs to be compromised or the holder needs to be malicious

### Attack Path

1. DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE holder identifies valuable tokens in the PinlinkShop contract
2. DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE holder calls rescueToken() with:
- The address of the target token (not REWARDS_TOKEN)
- The address where they want to receive the tokens
3. The rescueToken() function checks that the token is not REWARDS_TOKEN
4. The function transfers all balance of the specified token to the specified address
5. The attack is successful, and user assets are extracted

### Impact

The affected users suffer a potential loss of all their staked assets and payment tokens. The attacker (DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE holder) gains all extracted assets.
Detailed explanation:
1. Loss to users:
- All staked assets in the contract
- All PIN tokens used for payments
- Any other ERC20 tokens accidentally sent to the contract
- The loss is potentially 100% of their assets in the contract
2. Gain to attacker:
- All extracted assets
- Full control over the extracted tokens
- No cost to execute the attack (only gas fees)
3. Additional impact:
- Loss of trust in the protocol
- Potential protocol insolvency
- Complete disruption of protocol operations

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Implement proper permission separation:
- Create a dedicated TREASURER_ROLE for emergency token extraction
- Limit DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to system parameter management only
2. Add security controls:
- Implement multi-signature requirement for token extraction
- Add time-lock period for large extractions
- Set maximum extraction limits per transaction
