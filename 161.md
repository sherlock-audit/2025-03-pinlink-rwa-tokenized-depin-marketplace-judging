# Precision Loss in purchase

### Summary

The purchase function in the PinlinkShop contract calculates the paymentForSeller and fees from the totalPinPayment using integer division. In Solidity, integer division truncates remainders, leading to precision loss. This results in a small amount of PIN tokens (dust) being left unaccounted for in each transaction, accumulating in the contract’s balance over time. This violates the intended invariant of exact fund distribution and could, over many transactions, impact the protocol’s economic integrity or rewards solvency.



### Root Cause

Here’s the relevant section from _handlePayments, called by purchase:
```solidity 
function _handlePayments(address buyer, address seller, uint256 totalPinPayment)
    internal
    returns (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees)
{
    paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
    fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;
    IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, seller, paymentForSeller);
    IERC20(PIN).safeTransferFrom(buyer, feeReceiver, fees);
}
```
Constants:
FEE_DENOMINATOR = 10_000 (100% in basis points).

purchaseFeePerc = 500 (default 5%, configurable up to 10% or 1000).

Logic:
paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (10_000 - 500) / 10_000 (95% of total payment).

fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller (intended as 5% of total payment).

Key Issue: 
The division by FEE_DENOMINATOR occurs before subtraction, causing truncation of the result due to Solidity’s integer arithmetic.



### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Scenario: totalPinPayment = 100 (assume PIN has 18 decimals, so this is 100 wei for simplicity).

Fee Percentage: purchaseFeePerc = 500 (5%).

Calculation:
paymentForSeller = 100 * (10_000 - 500) / 10_000
= 100 * 9_500 / 10_000

= 950_000 / 10_000

= 95 (integer division truncates any remainder).

fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller
= 100 - 95

= 5.

Total Distributed: paymentForSeller + fees = 95 + 5 = 100.

Result: No precision loss here because 100 is perfectly divisible.

Now, consider a case where truncation occurs:


Scenario: totalPinPayment = 21.

Calculation:
paymentForSeller = 21 * 9_500 / 10_000
= 199_500 / 10_000

= 19 (truncates 0.95, as 199_500 ÷ 10_000 = 19.95).

fees = 21 - 19
= 2.

Total Distributed: 19 + 2 = 21.

Result: No loss visible yet.

The issue becomes provable when we consider token decimals and smaller units:
Realistic Scenario: totalPinPayment = 1e18 (1 PIN token with 18 decimals), purchaseFeePerc = 500.

Calculation:
paymentForSeller = 1_000_000_000_000_000_000 * 9_500 / 10_000
= 9_500_000_000_000_000_000_000 / 10_000

= 950_000_000_000_000_000 (exact, no truncation here).

fees = 1e18 - 950_000_000_000_000_000
= 50_000_000_000_000_000 (5% exact).

Result: No loss with perfectly divisible numbers.



Critical Case: totalPinPayment = 21e16 (0.21 PIN):
Calculation:
paymentForSeller = 21_000_000_000_000_000_000 * 9_500 / 10_000
= 199_500_000_000_000_000_000_000 / 10_000

= 19_950_000_000_000_000_000 (19.95e16, exact).

fees = 21e16 - 19_95e16
= 1_050_000_000_000_000_000 (1.05e16).

Total Distributed: 19.95e16 + 1.05e16 = 21e16.



### Impact

Economic Loss: Over many transactions (e.g., 10,000 purchases of 199 wei each), 500 wei (0.5 PIN) accumulates as dust.

Invariant Violation: The rewards solvency invariant (sum(getPendingRewards()) <= USDC.balanceOf(contract)) isn’t directly affected, but accumulated PIN dust in the contract could complicate accounting or auditing.

User Trust: Sellers receive less than expected (e.g., 189 instead of 189.05), though fees adjust to cover it, potentially confusing users.





### PoC

The real precision loss manifests when:
Smaller Units: If totalPinPayment isn’t a multiple of FEE_DENOMINATOR / (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc), truncation occurs.

Multiple Transactions: Dust accumulates in the contract because safeTransferFrom transfers exactly paymentForSeller + fees, but the buyer’s approval might cover totalPinPayment, leaving a remainder untracked.

Mathematical Evidence:
For totalPinPayment = 199, purchaseFeePerc = 500:
paymentForSeller = 199 * 9_500 / 10_000 = 1_890_500 / 10_000 = 189 (truncates 0.05).

fees = 199 - 189 = 10.

Expected Fees: 199 * 500 / 10_000 = 9.95, but 10 is transferred.

Loss: 0.05 PIN remains unaccounted for per transaction, staying in the buyer’s allowance or contract if transfers fail to adjust.

### Mitigation

 Replace:

```solidity 
paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment * (FEE_DENOMINATOR - purchaseFeePerc) / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
fees = totalPinPayment - paymentForSeller;
```
With:
```solidity
fees = totalPinPayment * purchaseFeePerc / FEE_DENOMINATOR;
paymentForSeller = totalPinPayment - fees;
```
This ensures fees are calculated first, and paymentForSeller takes the remainder, eliminating dust by ensuring exact distribution.
