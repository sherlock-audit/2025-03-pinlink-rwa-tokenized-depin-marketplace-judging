# PIN token price will not be updated in volatile market conditions which can cause users to suffer losses

### Summary

`CentralizedOracle` forbids the owner from updating price data when price changes are too big, considering a bot will update prices and market can become volatile, this can lead to a state where `CentralizedOracle` will provide stale price data and users selling assets will endure losses. 


### Root Cause

In `updateTokenPrice` if the new price is five times smaller or five times bigger than the current price, function will revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

N/A

### External Pre-conditions

`_currentPrice ` in `CentralizedOracle` needs to be updated to a price of 5 times larger or smaller.

### Attack Path

1. PIN token price decreases sharply, off-chain bot will not be able to update the price
2. Buyers can use an amount of PIN to buy assets at a much lower price as outside the protocol PIN token will be cheap and inside PinLink it will be valued much more

### Impact

Sellers will suffer losses depending on the price change as updates to price will not be possible

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider removing these checks and employing a more robust oracle.
