# Hardcoded REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT Prevents Token Withdrawals and Distribution

### Summary

The PinLink contract uses a hardcoded dummy address `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT ` (`0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa`) s the `receiver` when enabling assets. This causes an issue where **only `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT** `has staked balances, but since it is not a real user-controlled address, withdrawals and token distribution become impossible.

The `_nonListedBalance `function checks if `msg.sender` has enough staked balance before allowing withdrawals, but since only `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT `has a balance, withdrawals will **always revert** unless `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT `is `msg.sender`, which is impossible. This results in permanent asset lock.

### Root Cause

1. When `enableAsset `is called, the total supply of a token is staked under `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT`:
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/streams.sol#L69
  - `receiver `is **hardcoded** as `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT`, not the actual sender.
  - This means **only `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT`** has a staked balance.

2. When users attempt to withdraw tokens via `withdrawAsset`, it calls `_nonListedBalance`:
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L353
  - `_nonListedBalance` checks `stakedBalances[msg.sender]`.
  **- Since only `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT `has a staked balance, all withdrawals fail.**

3. The `withdrawAsset` function also calls `transferBalances`, which requires the sender to have a valid staked balance

### Attack Path

### Impact

**Severe â€“ Funds Locked, Contract Becomes Unusable**
- `REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT` is **not controlled by anyone**, meaning tokens are permanently locked.
- The contract's main functionality (depositing, listing, and withdrawing tokens) **does not work because no one has enabled tokens**.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`REWARDS_PROXY_ACCOUNT `should not be the receiver in enable token
