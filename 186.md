# Fraction Sellers and Protocol Will Receive Reduced Payments from Buyers in PinLink Marketplace

### Summary

A failure to account for the PIN token’s fee-on-transfer mechanism in the `pinlinkShop` contract will cause an economic loss for sellers and fee receivers in the PinLink marketplace as the `_handlePayments` function transfers less PIN than expected due to the fact that PIN token is a fee on transfer token, as mentioned [here](https://github.com/JacoboLansac/audits/blob/main/solo/pinlink-phase1-audit.md#c-3-the-pinlink_staking-contract-is-insolvent-by-default-because-the-pin-token-is-a-fee-on-transfer-token)


### Root Cause

In `pinlinkShop.sol` ([lines 543-544](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L543-L544)), the `_handlePayments` function does not account the fact the the PIN token is a fee on transfer token. This results in the seller of the fractions and the fee receiver receiving less than the expected PIN token payments. It simply attempts to transfer the calculated amounts (`paymentForSeller` & `fees`), but does not adjust for the transfer fee deducted by the PIN token contract, causing receivers to get less than anticipated.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The admin needs to list 100 fractions of RWA asset in PinlinkShop with a usdPricePerFraction set to $100.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The PIN token charge a fee on transfers, just as it did in the PoC.

### Attack Path

1. Admin mints 100 fractions of some RWA asset.
2. Admin lists these factions in the marketplace
3. Alice sees this offer, has enough PIN and decides to buy all of the 100 fractions to have a passive income.
4. The price per fraction is $100 and the current PIN price is $10.
5. So Alice knows that she will need $10_000 in order to acquire these assets. So she sends the tx. 
6. However due to the nature of the PIN token, instead of Admin receiving the full amount of $10_000 he'll receive less. See PoC for more information.
7. Currently the Pinlink's admin but in the future this could be any regular user selling fractions — receives less than expected, resulting in an unintended loss.

### Impact

The sellers and fee receivers suffer financial loss

console output from the PoC showing that the admin received less than expected

  Admin pin balance before Alice buys:  0
  Admin pin balance after Alice buys:  950000000000000000000
  He should have received 10K, because the admin is also the feeReceiver and must receive the full payment but in reality he received less. He received only 950$
```

### PoC

### Steps to reproduce: 
1. Set the PIN token price to 10 ether which represents that it worths $10 and we will use this for easier calculations in `base.t.sol` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/test/pinlinkShop/base.t.sol#L43)
2. Copy paste the following file in `test/pinlinkShop` folder && run the test with the following command `forge test --mt test_feeOnTransferIssue -vv`

### Mitigation

Modify _handlePayments in pinlinkShop to calculate the required PIN amount before the transfer, accounting for the fee
