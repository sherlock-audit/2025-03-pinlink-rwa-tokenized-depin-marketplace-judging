# Anyone can get free rewards buy frontrunning deposit of rewards

## Description
The depositRewards function allows rewards to be deposited into a rewards stream. However, it is vulnerable to frontrunning attacks where malicious actors can deposit minimal amounts right before a large reward deposit, enabling them to claim free rewards without contributing proportionally.
