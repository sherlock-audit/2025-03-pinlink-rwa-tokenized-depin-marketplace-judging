# ListingID Collision Risk in PinlinkShop Contract

### Summary

The PinlinkShop contract generates listingId using a hash of multiple parameters, including block.number. While the current implementation includes safeguards against duplicate listings within the same block, there exists a theoretical risk of hash collision under specific conditions. The contract’s _list function mitigates this risk by checking for existing listingId entries, but edge cases could still lead to unintended behavior.

### Root Cause

The listingId is computed as:
```solidity
listingId = keccak256(
    abi.encode(fractionalAssets, tokenId, msg.sender, amount, usdPricePerFraction, deadline, block.number)
);
```
This algorithm introduces a collision risk if two distinct listings share identical parameters within the ​same block (e.g., same seller, asset, price, and amount). The use of block.number (instead of block.timestamp) reduces but does not eliminate collision risks, as transactions in the same block may generate identical hashes if parameters overlap.

### Attack Path

Phase 1 - Monitoring:

Attacker monitors pending transactions for legitimate listings.
​Phase 2 - Precomputation:

Upon detecting a target listing, the attacker precomputes its ID using:
predictedId = keccak256(..., block.number)  
​Phase 3 - Collision Attack:

The attacker submits a ​malicious listing with identical parameters in the same block.
Both transactions are included in the block, resulting in:
The second transaction overwrites the first due to identical listingId.
Legitimate listing is ​censored.
​Phase 4 - Profit Extraction:

The attacker’s listing gains priority, allowing them to:
Manipulate prices by replacing legitimate listings.
Front-run buyers to steal arbitrage opportunities.

### Impact

Legitimate sellers lose listing slots; buyers purchase manipulated assets.
