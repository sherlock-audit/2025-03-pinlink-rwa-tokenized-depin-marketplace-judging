# setupFractional.s.sol-- Hardcoded contract address and centralized minting strategy pose deployment and control risks

### Summary

The deployment script `FractionalTokenScript.s.sol` hardcodes a specific contract address (Line 10) and mints all tokens directly into a single EOA `DEV_WALLET` (Lines 20–31). This design introduces both configuration fragility and centralization risk that could lead to permanent asset loss or control compromise during production deployments.



### Root Cause

 • Line 10: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/fracitonal/setupFractional.s.sol#L10

FractionalAssets public fractionalAssets = FractionalAssets(0x82C4b8FF3C9016C775eD160D8D40E2614c44b9BA);
The contract address is hardcoded instead of being dynamically injected.


 • Lines 20–31: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/fracitonal/setupFractional.s.sol#L20-L31


Tokens are directly minted to a single developer-controlled wallet, rather than a multisig or decentralized vault.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The script is reused on another chain or environment without modifying the hardcoded address.
 2. The DEV_WALLET is used in production without adequate operational security (e.g., multisig or hardware wallet).
 3. No on-chain verification of minting destinations or transfer constraints.


### External Pre-conditions

1. The script is reused on another chain or environment without modifying the hardcoded address.
2. The DEV_WALLET is used in production without adequate operational security (e.g., multisig or hardware wallet).
3. No on-chain verification of minting destinations or transfer constraints.


### Attack Path

1. Developer runs the script on a new network without updating Line 10.
2. Script mints to a contract address that doesn’t support the proper logic or is nonexistent.
3. Alternatively, if DEV_WALLET is compromised, attacker gains full control over all seeded fractional assets.


### Impact

• Severe asset loss if tokens are minted to an incorrect or incompatible contract.
 • Complete asset control transfer if DEV_WALLET is exploited.
 • Centralization optics risk — critical early assets appear controlled by a single EOA.



### PoC

// Line 10
FractionalAssets public fractionalAssets = FractionalAssets(0x82C4b8FF3C9016C775eD160D8D40E2614c44b9BA);

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/script/fracitonal/setupFractional.s.sol#L10


// Lines 20–31
fractionalAssets.mint(3662385719, DEV_WALLET, 100);
fractionalAssets.mint(2011064538, DEV_WALLET, 100);
// ...etc
fractionalAssets.mint(3252672878, DEV_WALLET, 100);

Run this on a fork of another chain — assets are either unrecoverable (wrong contract) or exposed (central wallet).



### Mitigation

 • Replace Line 10 with dynamic injection:

`FractionalAssets public fractionalAssets =FractionalAssets(vm.envAddress("FRACTIONAL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"));`

 • Mint directly to a multisig-admin address or vault instead of DEV_WALLET.
 • Add network verification in run() to prevent unintended broadcasts.
