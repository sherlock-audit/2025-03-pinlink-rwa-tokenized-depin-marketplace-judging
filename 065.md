# Setting Fee Percentage to 0 leads to DOS of purchase functionality

### Summary

Function to setFee should allow every value from <0;1000>. But setting value to 0 (0% fee taken on purchase) makes every purchase transaction revert. This is due to the fact that function `_handlePayments` sends fee amount in PIN tokens and when fee = 0, the transaction will revert because of internal check inside `_transfer` function in PIN token code (`require(amount > 0)`).

### Root Cause

Inside the PIN token there is require statement that amount transfered must be greater than zero. Protocol should support setting fees to zero.
Inside the `_handlePayments` which is invoked in the purchase function, the fees are calculated and they are send to the fee receiver. But when fees are set to zero, the amount send to fee receiver will be 0, so the transaction will always revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. There is enabled Asset
2. The enabled asset is listed on the contract
3. The Admin should set fees to 0

### External Pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin sets Fees to 0
2. User tries to purchase from the listing expecting deducted fees to be equal to zero
3. Transaction always reverts leading to DOS of purchase function

### Impact

The expected result is not acomplished. Users should be able to purchase from listings without any fees, but are unable to purchase from listings because the purchase function always reverts.
Admin here is *NOT* trying to harm user. Admin here is trusted but the result of the action is different than anticipated.

### Mitigation

Implement check if fee amount is equal to zero, then do not transfer fee amount.
