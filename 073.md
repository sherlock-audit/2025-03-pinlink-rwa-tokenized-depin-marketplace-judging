# Missing Asset Transfer in Purchase Function

### Summary

The absence of asset transfer in the purchase function will cause financial loss for buyers as they will pay PIN tokens but not receive the fractional assets they purchased.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L395

### Root Cause

In [pinklink_audit/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace-king-null/pinklink_audit/src/marketplaces/pinlinkShop.sol#L396-L422) the purchase function transfers payment tokens but lacks an actual transfer of the purchased assets to the buyer.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The purchase function updates internal accounting via transferBalances but doesn't transfer actual assets
There's no separate claim function for buyers to get their assets post-purchase

### External Pre-conditions

.

### Attack Path

A buyer sees a listing they want to purchase
They call the purchase function and pay in PIN tokens
The payment is successfully transferred to the seller and fee receiver
The buyer never receives the fractional assets they paid for
The buyer has no way to claim or access their purchased assets

### Impact

Buyers lose the full amount paid for assets that they never receive, resulting in complete financial loss equal to the purchase amount.

### PoC

```solidity
function testBuyerPaysButGetsNothing() public {
    // Setup
    address buyer = address(1);
    bytes32 listingId = _createAndGetValidListing();
    uint256 price = shop.getQuoteInTokens(listingId, 10);
    
    // Buyer approves PIN tokens
    vm.startPrank(buyer);
    IERC20(PIN).approve(address(shop), price);
    
    // Buyer purchases 10 fractions
    shop.purchase(listingId, 10, price);
    
    // Verify buyer's PIN was transferred
    assertLt(IERC20(PIN).balanceOf(buyer), INITIAL_BALANCE);
    
    // But fractional asset was never transferred to buyer
    assertEq(IFractionalAssets(fractionalAsset).balanceOf(buyer, tokenId), 0);
    vm.stopPrank();
}

```

### Mitigation

```solidity
function purchase(bytes32 listingId, uint256 fractionsAmount, uint256 maxTotalPinAmount) external {
    // Existing code...
    
    // After payment is handled:
    IFractionalAssets(fractionalAssets).safeTransferFrom(
        address(this), 
        msg.sender, 
        tokenId, 
        fractionsAmount, 
        ""
    );
    
    emit Purchased(listingId, msg.sender, seller, fractionsAmount, paymentForSeller, fees, totalUsdPayment);
}

```
