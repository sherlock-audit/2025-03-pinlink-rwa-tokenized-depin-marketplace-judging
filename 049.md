# push type oracle opens the door for mev

### Summary

Oracle price updates being pushed directly to the contract by the owner. This means the transaction will sit in the mempool and frontrunnable by mev bots.

### Root Cause

the [updateTokenPrice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L52-L53) function immediately updates the token price without any delay or time-weighted transition mechanism, creating an opportunity for frontrunning attacks.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The owner of the CentralizedOracle contract calls updateTokenPrice() to update the PIN/USD price
2. The price change must be significant enough to make the attack profitable but still within the allowed range (between 1/5× and 5× of the current price)
3. The`fractionalAssets`  must be quite liquid.

### External Pre-conditions

Owner registers significant, PIN price change, this could happen through asset volatility or even through an attack on the centralized oracle. Since the oracle is a bot that relies on external feeds, if one feed is attacked this may impact price.

### Attack Path

1. The owner of the CentralizedOracle submits a transaction to update the PIN/USD exchange rate

2. An attacker observes a $PIN price **decrease**, pending transaction in the mempool

It will cost pin to buy the asset before the price update and sell it after the price update. This way the frontrunner can also sell his asset below market price, guaranteeing faster liquidity.

**Scenario: PIN value is about to decrease**

Current rate: 1 $PIN = $1 USD
Upcoming rate: 1 $PIN = $0.80 USD
Asset price: $100 USD

Before the update, you pay 100 $PIN for the asset.
After the update, you would pay 125 $PIN for the same asset.

So the asset could be listed or sold on secondary markets for 113 $PIN (90USD) , allowing the frontrunner to profit quickly from this situation.  


### Impact

Sellers will absorb losses caused by the arbitrageurs. The market value of the fractional asset will also be impacted.
Sellers will suffer indirect loss through asset market value decrease 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It could be more reliable to list the assets in either $PIN and receive $PIN or USD and receive a USD token.
Prices the price gap between updates might be too big, 5x times change sounds excessive, consider greatly reducing  this number.
