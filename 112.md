# Stale Price Data Due to 7-Day Threshold

### Summary

The CentralizedOracle’s 7-day STALENESS_THRESHOLD will cause transaction failures for PinlinkShop users as the oracle returns a price of 0 after 7 days without updates, halting all price-dependent operations.

### Root Cause

In CentralizedOracle.sol:17, the STALENESS_THRESHOLD is set to 7 days. If the owner fails to update the price within this window, convertToUsd and convertFromUsd return 0, making the oracle unusable.

### Internal Pre-conditions

    Admin Inaction: The owner does not call updateTokenPrice() for over 7 days.

### External Pre-conditions

    Time Dependency: The last price update timestamp (lastPriceUpdateTimestamp) must be older than 7 days.

### Attack Path

.

### Impact

    Affected Party: All PinlinkShop users.

    Loss: Users cannot buy/sell assets, and rewards distribution halts until the oracle is updated.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

    Reduce Threshold: Set STALENESS_THRESHOLD to 24–48 hours.

    Automate Alerts: Implement off-chain monitoring to alert the owner before staleness.
