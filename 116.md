# Centralized Oracle can hurt either buyers/sellers by forcing price of PIN/USD to remain outdated

### Summary

`CentralizedOracle` is a centralized oracle in which TOKEN/USD prices are updated, which should be accomplished by a bot. However, according to the docs, the bot will only check every X minutes if price needs to be updated, and the only if the new price differs more than y% from the current price. x and y are yet to be defined.
The problem arises whenever the price of the TOKEN, in this case PIN, deviates from the `CentralizedOracle` price.

### Root Cause

If the bot only checks every x minutes for price updates, and if between x and x+1 the price of PIN in USD terms changes, then any sale/purchase of fractional assets will be based on an outdated price.

### Internal Pre-conditions

Assets are listed for sale.

### External Pre-conditions

PIN/USD rises/falls between x and x+1 interval in protocol's source oracles.

### Attack Path

Since neither x nor y have been defined, let us assume x is 5min. This means that buyers can benefit of any z% USD discount within intervals of 5min, if PIN/USD falls by z%.


```javascript
    function purchase(bytes32 listingId, uint256 fractionsAmount, uint256 maxTotalPinAmount) external {
        require(fractionsAmount > 0, ExpectedNonZero());

        Listing storage listing = _listings[listingId];

        address seller = listing.seller;
        uint256 tokenId = listing.tokenId;
        address fractionalAssets = listing.fractionalAssets;

        require(seller != address(0), InvalidListingId());
        require(block.timestamp < listing.deadline, ListingDeadlineExpired());

        {
            uint256 listedAmount = listing.amount;
            if (listedAmount < fractionsAmount) revert NotEnoughTokens();
            listing.amount = listedAmount - fractionsAmount;
            _listedBalances[fractionalAssets][tokenId][seller] -= fractionsAmount;

            streams[fractionalAssets][tokenId].transferBalances(seller, msg.sender, fractionsAmount);
        }

@>      uint256 totalUsdPayment = listing.usdPricePerFraction * fractionsAmount;
@>      uint256 totalPinPayment = IPinlinkOracle(oracle).convertFromUsd(address(PIN), totalUsdPayment);

        if (totalPinPayment == 0) revert StaleOraclePrice();
        if (totalPinPayment > maxTotalPinAmount) revert SlippageExceeded();

        (uint256 paymentForSeller, uint256 fees) = _handlePayments(msg.sender, seller, totalPinPayment);

        emit Purchased(listingId, msg.sender, seller, fractionsAmount, paymentForSeller, fees, totalUsdPayment);
    }
```

If a user calls `purchase()` to buy 10 `fractionsAmount`:
Assume `listing.usdPricePerFraction = 10e18` then => `totalUsdPayment = 10e18 * 10 = 100e18` or 100USD.
Then, from `convertFromUsd(address(PIN), totalUsdPayment)` we get:
    `(totalUsdPayment * SCALE) / _tokenPriceInUsd`

PIN/USD is currently trading at roughly 0.83 cents, so let's that take value:
`convertFromUsd(address(PIN), totalUsdPayment) = (100e18 * 1e18) / 0.83e18`
<=>`convertFromUsd(address(PIN), totalUsdPayment) = 120.48`
So the user would have to pay a total of 120.48 PIN for the 10 asset fractions.

Now assume that within 5min, the price of PIN drops by 20% in terms of USD, from 0.83 cents to 0.664 cents.
If the price were updated in time, then `convertFromUsd(address(PIN), totalUsdPayment) = (100e18 * 1e18) / 0.664e18 = 150.6`. So the user would pay 150.6 PIN for the same asset fractions.
The user gets instead a `150.6 - 120.48 = 30.12 PIN` discount, which means the seller got 30.12-fees fewer PIN.
This also means the user paid the USD PIN equivalent of `120.48 * 0.664 = 80 USD` instead of 100USD.

If the user lists these assets for sale at the same `usdPricePerFraction` or withdraws the asset to sell it elsewhere, he will get a $20 profit from this. The seller would receive 20-fees USD less.

### Impact

This creates an arbitrage opportunity, and buyers can know in advance what the price of the TOKEN will be in the protocol before it is actually updated, by listening to the protocol's source oracles or by monitoring calls to `updateTokenPrice()`.
This also means that sellers can get less revenue than they expected, and the listing of fractional assets can turn out very disfavourable for them.
Either sellers rely on themselves as an oracle and constantly call `modifyListing()` to not be harmed, or they must rely on the centralized oracle.

In this example PIN/USD fell, but this applies either way. If PIN/USD rises before the `CentralizedOracle` updates the TOKEN price, sellers can take advantage of buyers instead.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

This is really a structural problem, so if the solution is not to use a Chainlink price feed yet, it would be best to ensure that the price check rate is tightened the most for the bot, and/or the same for y, for any price deviation of y%.
