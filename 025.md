# An attacker or mismanagement will block purchase transactions, impacting marketplace users

### Summary

Reliance on a centralized oracle that returns zero for stale price updates will cause a denial-of-service for marketplace users as an attacker or mismanagement will let the oracle price become stale, triggering purchase transactions to revert.


### Root Cause

- In **CentralizedOracle.sol**, the [functions ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/main/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L74)`convertToUsd` and `convertFromUsd` return 0 if the time elapsed since the last price update exceeds the staleness threshold (7 days). This behavior causes the purchase function in **PinlinkShop.sol** to revert with a `StaleOraclePrice` error when a transaction is attempted with an outdated price.


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to not update the oracle price, leaving `lastPriceUpdateTimestamp` to be older than 7 days relative to the current block timestamp.  
2. The purchase function in **PinlinkShop.sol** must call the oracle’s conversion functions expecting a non-zero value, which then returns 0 due to staleness.

### External Pre-conditions

1. The external oracle update mechanism must fail to provide a new price update for at least 7 days.

### Attack Path

1. The oracle’s price is not updated, causing the `lastPriceUpdateTimestamp` to exceed the 7-day staleness threshold.  
2. A user (or attacker) initiates a purchase transaction by calling the `purchase` function in **PinlinkShop.sol**.  
3. The `purchase` function computes the total USD payment and calls `convertFromUsd` on the stale oracle.  
4. The oracle returns 0 due to the outdated price, triggering the `StaleOraclePrice` error in the purchase function.  
5. The transaction reverts, effectively blocking the purchase.

### Impact

Marketplace users cannot complete purchase transactions, resulting in a denial-of-service that halts trading on the platform. This may lead to potential economic losses and a degradation of platform trust.


### PoC

```solidity
// Assume the oracle's lastPriceUpdateTimestamp is over 7 days old

// Buyer attempts to purchase fractions from a listing
pinlinkShop.purchase(listingId, fractionsAmount, maxTotalPinAmount);

// The call reverts with a StaleOraclePrice error because the oracle's convertFromUsd returns 0.
```
