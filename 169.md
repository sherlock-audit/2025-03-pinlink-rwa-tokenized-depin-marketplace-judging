# Token Transfer Reverts and Purchase Failures Due to Max Wallet Token Limit in Pin token Implementation.

**Summary**:  
The failure in purchasing fractionalized assets is due to a wallet limitation imposed by the PIN token contract. Specifically, the issue arises when a buyer attempts to purchase a large quantity of assets, which would cause the buyer’s wallet balance to exceed the maximum limit of 10,000 tokens. This limitation results in transaction reverts, preventing successful purchases. The problem occurs when the buyer’s wallet, after receiving the transferred tokens, exceeds the allowed balance of 10,000 PIN tokens.

**Root Cause**:  
The core issue stems from a restriction within the PIN token contract that limits individual wallet balances to a maximum of 10,000 tokens. The contract contains a check that ensures the total tokens a wallet holds (current balance + incoming transfer) does not exceed the maximum allowed amount (calculated as `totalTokens / maxWalletRatio`). When the transfer amount plus the current balance exceeds this limit, the transaction is reverted with the error: "Max wallet will be exceeded."

In the case of fractional asset purchases, if a buyer attempts to purchase the entire supply of an Fractional_asset which could go grow upto 10000 for particular token_id (e.g., 10,000 fractionalized tokens), the amount of tokens transferred to the supplier wallet would exceed the limit, causing the transaction to fail. 

`Lets understand it with example, `
`1st`, The issue can occur if the buyer want to purchase huge quantity of tokens like 10000 which is Max, and if keep price of each Fractional asset is $1.5 PIN token, => 15000, which would easily cross the Mac balance of supplier account, notice we kept the minimum price for per Fractional_asset.

`2nd`, the issue can even occur if supplier sells the Each Fractional_asset too costly, which is in there hand and there is no restriction over that value, then also the quantity calculated will surpass 10000. Assume charging $100 worth of Pin for each Fraction_Asset, so less quantity will also affect this.

This occurs even though the total amount of tokens is valid and the transaction itself may be legitimate; the restriction on individual wallet balance is the critical factor leading to the revert.

```solidity
    function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) private {
     -------
        ) {
            // Max tx check
            require(amount <= totalTokens / maxTxRatio, "Max tx exceeded.");

            // Buys
            if (
                (mappedAddresses[from].isLPPair) &&
                to != address(uniswapV2Router)
            ) {
                _taxAmt = buyTax;
                // Max wallet check
                require(
                    balanceOf(to) + amount <= totalTokens / maxWalletRatio, @---> issue
                    "Max wallet will be exceeded."
                );
            } else if (
                (mappedAddresses[to].isLPPair) &&
                from != address(uniswapV2Router)
            ) {
    --------
            } else {
                // No code to change transfer tax
                _taxAmt = 0;
                // Still check max wallet
                require(
                    balanceOf(to) + amount <= totalTokens / maxWalletRatio,
                    "Max wallet will be exceeded."
                );
            }
    -----

**Impact**:  
1. **Transaction Failures**: Buyers who attempt to purchase large quantities of assets, especially the entire fractional supply (e.g., 10,000 units), will experience reverted transactions because their wallet would exceed the 10,000 PIN token limit.
2. **Purchasing Limitations**: Buyers are constrained by the maximum wallet capacity of 10,000 tokens for supplier. Even if they have sufficient funds to purchase a large number of fractional assets, they may not be able to complete the transaction if it pushes supplier balance over this limit.
3. **Operational Complexity**: Buyers and suppliers must carefully manage token quantities and wallet balances, potentially leading to more manual transactions, delays, and confusion for users.
4. **Limited Flexibility for Large Purchases**: The restriction limits the flexibility for both buyers and suppliers when dealing with large-scale transactions.

**Mitigation**:  
1. If possible upgrade the logic of PIN token contract, which can resolve this issue
2. redesign the execution how purchase and overall execution is taking place
