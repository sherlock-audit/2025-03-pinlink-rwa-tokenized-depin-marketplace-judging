# updateTokenPrice() function  in CentralizedOracle  contract is vulnerable to front-running and back-running attack

### Summary

Due to Centralized oracle implementation, Attacker can front-run or back-run `CentralizedOracle:updateTokenPrice()` with  `PinlinkShop:purchase()` or `PinlinkShop :modifyListing()` function to his benefit.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-03-pinlink-rwa-tokenized-depin-marketplace/blob/34cd70b66f1dbe191bd6f946e42f58eef4a00166/marketplace-contracts/src/oracles/CentralizedOracle.sol#L55C6-L57C97
Admin/Owner changes pin Token price by calling  `CentralizedOracle :updateTokenPrice()` function  and the new price can be in the range `(currentPrice/5) < updatedPrice < (currenPrice*5)`
```solidity
 function updateTokenPrice(uint256 usdPerToken) external onlyOwner {
        uint256 _currentPrice = _tokenPriceInUsd;

        // sanity checks to avoid too large deviations caused by bot/human errors
        if (usdPerToken < _currentPrice / 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooLow();
        if (usdPerToken > _currentPrice * 5) revert PinlinkCentralizedOracle__NewPriceTooHigh();

        _tokenPriceInUsd = usdPerToken;
        lastPriceUpdateTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        // todo potential improvement. Everytime we update, we crosscheck the price with the Uniswap spot price
        //  - centralized, but controlled by a decentralized oracle, so that we can't manipulate it
        //  - cheaper to run than a TWAP oracle
        //  - less manipulable (except by us)

        emit PriceUpdated(usdPerToken);
    }
```
If there's a big jump in price, Attacker can perform front-run or back-run to his benefit.

### Internal Pre-conditions

No-Response

### External Pre-conditions

No-Response

### Attack Path

1. Admin call `CentralizedOracle:updateTokenPrice()` to cahnge price. (Big jump in price)
2. Attacker sees this in mempool
3. Then Attacker can  front-run or back-run this function call to his benefit by calling either `purchase()` or `modifyListing()` to his benefit

### Impact

Likelihood is high as block cadence in Ethereum main net is around 12s. Front-running attacks are possible. Impact is medium.

### PoC

Front running and back-running can be done in various combinations.
1. Attacker can buy a listing with low price by back-running `updateTokenPrice()` function call with `purchase()` function call if price is falling down significantly 
2. Attacker can perform front-running  `updateTokenPrice()` function call with `modifyListing()` function call to change the price of his listing.

### Mitigation

Use Twap mechanisms in the oracle implementation.
