# Reward Update DoS via Malicious Contracts in transferBalances

### Summary

Malicious contract acting as either the from or to address in the transferBalances function of the StreamHandler library can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by reverting or consuming excessive gas during the updateRewards calls. This blocks staking balance transfers, disrupting operations like asset purchases or withdrawals in pinlinkShop.sol. The attacker could deploy a contract with a malicious onERC1155Received function to exploit this, though the root issue lies in the external calls within transferBalances. This is rated as a Medium severity issue due to its impact on protocol functionality without direct financial loss.



### Root Cause

In streams.sol, the transferBalances function includes external calls to updateRewards for both the from and to addresses:
```solidity
function transferBalances(RewardsStream storage self, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    self.updateRewards(from); // ❗ External call to `from`
    self.updateRewards(to);   // ❗ External call to `to`
    self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount;
    self.stakedBalances[to] += amount;
}
```

The updateRewards function itself does not make explicit external calls in the provided streams.sol code:
```solidity
function updateRewards(RewardsStream storage self, address account) internal {
    uint256 globalPerStaked = self.globalRewardsPerStaked();
    self.pendingRewards[account] += self._pendingRewardsSinceLastUpdate(globalPerStaked, account);
    self.updatedRewardsPerStaked[account] = globalPerStaked;
}
```

However, transferBalances is called in contexts like purchase or withdrawAsset in pinlinkShop.sol, where the to or from address might be a contract receiving ERC1155 tokens via safeTransferFrom. The ERC1155 standard requires the recipient contract to implement onERC1155Received, and a malicious implementation could revert or consume excessive gas, indirectly causing updateRewards to fail when part of a larger transaction. The vulnerability arises from the lack of isolation between balance transfers and reward updates, making the function susceptible to reentrancy or gas-related DoS



### Internal Pre-conditions



1. An attacker controls an address (either from or to) involved in a transferBalances call, which is triggered by functions like purchase or withdrawAsset in pinlinkShop.sol.

2. The attacker’s address is a contract with a malicious onERC1155Received function that reverts or performs gas-intensive operations when called during ERC1155 transfers tied to transferBalances.






### External Pre-conditions

None```solidity

```

### Attack Path

1. Attacker Deploys Malicious Contract: The attacker deploys a contract with a malicious onERC1155Received function that either reverts or consumes excessive gas (e.g., an infinite loop capped by gas limit).

```solidity
contract MaliciousReceiver {
    function onERC1155Received(...) external returns (bytes4) {
        while (gasleft() > 1000) {} // Gas-intensive loop
        return this.onERC1155Received.selector;
    }
}
```
2. Attacker Initiates Interaction: The attacker lists assets for sale using this contract as the seller or attempts to receive assets as the buyer, triggering a call to transferBalances in pinlinkShop.sol (e.g., via purchase).
3. Transfer Triggers ERC1155 Call: During purchase, after transferBalances updates staking balances, pinlinkShop.sol calls safeTransferFrom to move ERC1155 tokens to the to address (e.g., the malicious contract).

4. Malicious Response Blocks Transaction: The malicious onERC1155Received executes, either reverting or exhausting gas, causing the entire transaction—including the transferBalances call—to fail.

5. DoS Achieved: Legitimate users cannot complete transactions involving the attacker’s contract, stalling marketplace operations.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a disruption in staking balance transfers
This is a denial-of-service issue, not a fund theft vulnerability.





### PoC

None

### Mitigation

1. To prevent this DoS vulnerability, separate reward updates from balance transfers by adopting a pull-based reward system:  
Remove updateRewards from transferBalances:  
solidity
```solidity
function transferBalances(RewardsStream storage self, address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    self.stakedBalances[from] -= amount;
    self.stakedBalances[to] += amount;
}
```
2. Track Rewards Separately: Modify RewardsStream to accrue rewards based on staking balance snapshots and timestamps, updated only when users call claimRewards:
solidity
```solidity
 function claimRewards(RewardsStream storage self, address account) internal returns (uint256) {
    self.updateRewards(account); // Safe here as user-initiated
    uint256 claimed = self.pendingRewards[account];
    delete self.pendingRewards[account];
    return claimed;
}
```
